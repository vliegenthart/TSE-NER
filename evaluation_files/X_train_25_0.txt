She not only used Orkut herself but created accounts for her mother  , sister  , and brother. One of our participants  , an 18-year-old student  , was not only technologically-savvy in terms of adopting new websites and exploring advanced features of computer applications  , she was also a strong " gifter. "More details and further experimental results are available at http://swa.cefriel.it/geo/eswc2016.html. Furthermore  , according to global OpenStreetMap statistics 1   , Italy and UK are ranked 7th and 10th for number of created spatial objects  , and 4th and 5th for density of created spatial objects per square kilometer.These are the two Wikia encyclopedias with the largest number of articles evaluated by users regarding their quality. From the Wikia service  , we selected the encyclopedias Wookieepedia  , about the Star Wars universe  , and Muppet  , about the TV series " The Muppet Show " .From a theoretical point of view  , it would be interesting to see how far we can generalize this to arbitrary matching problems  , i.e. the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to.OpenStreetMap. Our data is aggregated every 60 minutes  , comes from both TIM customers and roaming customers in the six cities  , and covers the time ranging from February to October 2014.In ranked lists  , users cannot understand " what the resource is about " without opening and investigating the LOD resource itself. Sindice 1  , Watson 2  adopt keyword-based search and ranked result lists presentation of traditional Information Retrieval IR  , which is not very efficient for large volumes of data 3 .Section 2 provides a short description of the used Blog06 collection. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.We augmented these by pulling from a few repositories on GitHub that were aimed at collecting source code examples. We obtained our snippets from the Stack Overflow data repository provided for the 2013 MSR Challenge 3.The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper. Therefore  , we chose to only report MAP results in this paper  , since we consider MAP as more representative of the performance of an approach with regard to all results.The user narrows down the search to " software industry " 5 which reduces the results to 246. A search with " ICT industry growth in EU " presents 272 results from EconStor; the STW terms used in this search are " ICT industry " and " economic growth " .Often data providers will export records from sources that are not Unicode-based. As a developing service Citebase often needs to completely re-harvest its metadata  , and using a local mirror avoids repeatedly making very large requests to source archives.In this paper  , we presented and evaluated GERBIL  , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks. In the future  , we also plan to provide information about the point in time since when an annotator is stable  , i.e.  , the algorithm underlying the webservice has not changed.Github provided an initial set of 1 ,733 projects meeting this criterion. As a concession to ease of analysis  , only projects using the popular Maven 4 build system were considered.Previous work on open source software projects and developers suggests that there is a complex social and technical structure around the concept of making contributions to projects. Informed by previous work  , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.Knowing that hundreds or thousands of users  , some highly visible  , depend on a particular project may discourage project managers from accepting risky or uncertain code contributions. For popular projects  , the transparent nature of GitHub means project managers are aware  , at least in part  , of the identity of users of their project 5.The experimental results show that our approach can improve the base algorithm significantly with better precision  , recall and conversion rates. We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.The project has been collecting data since February 2012. The GHTorrent dataset covers a broad range of development activities on Github  , including pull requests and issues.The recommendation engine in Jester 1.0 retrieved jokes using nearest neighbor search. Based on the data gathered  , we developed a new recommendation algorithm that runs in linear time.Our study is based on data from the Github collaborative development forge  , as made available through our GHTorrent project 16. We then examine 291 carefully selected Ruby  , Python  , Java and Scala projects in total  , 166 ,884 pull requests  , and identify  , using qualitative and quantitative analysis  , the factors that affect pull request lifetime  , merging and rejection.the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to. This is a very realistic setting for concrete applications as there is often a central ontology  , i.e.To represent two different dimensions of the social connections in GitHub  , we used a measure for social distance and another for prior interaction. Events include participating in issues  , pull requests  , and commenting on various GitHub artifacts.This annotation has been widely adopted; for example  , GitHub contains about 35 ,000 uses of the annotation in 7 ,000 files https://github.com/search ?l=java&q=GuardedBy&type=Code. The intention is that when a locking discipline is expressed with @GuardedBy  , then " No set of operations performed sequentially or concurrently on instances of a thread-safe class can cause an instance to be in an invalid state " ; a thread-safe class is one that " uses synchronization whenever accessing the shared  , mutable state " .To investigate the problem  , we closely looked at the blog06 corpus and found that many permalink URLs were not properly extracted from the corresponding feed files. In other words  , splog detection and relevance aggregation did not improve MAP in the current settings.Both Sig.ma and Sindice are document-based and don't offer SWS discovery features or search for data using SWS. It crawls the web continuously to index new documents and update the indexed ones.Integrators should be both proactive   , by establishing and perhaps even documenting a professional communication etiquette  , and reactive  , by following discussions and intervening in cases where discussion diverges from the etiquette . Awareness can be increased by contacting the development team using real-time communication channels e.g.  , IRC or its evolved counterpart GITTER  , which is better integrated in GitHub or by following the minimal PR idiom 7  depending on project preferences.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github. With just one click  , the contributor can reject or approve a statement  , and  , in case of approval  , add the statement to Wikidata.For the implementation we use EconStor and an RDF dump file of Econstor. As a result  , an author's profile is enriched with additional information found in the cluster.This text was converted to upper-case and cleaned using a series of regular expressions. Raw text was extracted from the XML format of the AQU- AINT-2 and Blog06 collections.The ontology defines risk factors that are relevant to breast cancer. Statements like " having BRCA1 gene mutation increases the risk of developing breast cancer by a factor of four " are the examples of the relative risk.The website is not used only for collaboration  , but also as a resource to find quality software. In addition to that  , GitHub users can follow other users  , to be notified of their actions.Following the Gene Ontology terminology  , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms   , such as acronyms. This allows us to not only add synonyms of " ACP " to the query  , but also " ACP1 " and " ACP2 " .These include the ability for developers to "follow" other members in the community and to "star" the repositories of different projects. GitHub also provides a set of social networking features.Thus it is impossible for a user to read all new stories related to his/her interested topics. According to a recent survey made by Technorati 7  , there are about 75 ,000 new RSS feeds and 1.2 million new stories daily.It is not uncommon to find prolific developers contributing code to 5-10 GitHub projects in the same week. With the advent of social coding tools like GitHub  , this has intensified.There has been increased activity in development and integration of ontologies. The Open Biomedical Ontologies project 14 and the Gene Ontology Consortium 16 are an example of two related efforts for developing a coherent set of ontologies for this domain.the Sindice dump for each entity candidate. At the final stage  , we perform search in the link open data LOD collection  , i.e.Changes that required high amounts of discussion tend to be more closely scrutinized by more members of the site  , as GitHub users would look at discussion on a contribution as a signal of controversy. Certain contributions raise uncertainty about their value for a project and subsequently generate more discussion 19.I always got these favorites and these retweets  , and then I got followers on GitHub on the project. " . The process for data cross-linking is based and initiated from the metadata that are used to describe the authors and publications in EconStor. Given this  , the set of publications where a is author is represented asThese two sub-collections are built from the same crawl; however  , blank nodes are filtered out in Sindice-ED  , therefore it is a subset of Sindice-DE. The dataset is available in two different formats: structured around documents Sindice-DE and structured around entities Sindice-ED.Interestingly  , CMU  , the top performing group  , experimented with both types of index  , and concluded that an index based on the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection leads to a better retrieval performance on this task. The rest of the groups only indexed the Permalinks component of the collection.The situation with Brazilian blogs was also challenging: The blogger.com.br domain lacks a group of easily identifiable reputable hosts that are at the center of the community. We believe that it would be possible for a search engine company to perform this analysis  , either automatically e.g.  , using statistical natural language processing and/or by relying on white-lists provided by vigilante groups  , such as Technorati.The ten largest repositories by size in MB from our 9/2/2006 OAIster harvest are listed in Table 1. State documents from Illinois  , Alaska  , Arizona  , Montana  , etc.can observe the tendency that the property sets convey more information than type sets. An exception is the Datahub data set D  , where the distribution of resources in type sets and property sets seems comparable.The OpenStreetMap project has successfully applied the Wiki approach to geo data. In addition to using Triplify for publishing RDF from the long tail of million of Web applications deployed  , we evaluated the software with the very large datasets produced by the OpenStreetMap project 14 .OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger  , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API. InLinks We assume that non-personal blogs are more likely to have a large number of incoming links than personal ones  , and use the Technorati Cosmos API 2 to obtain this number.We randomly selected email addresses in batches of ten. We recruited eight participants from GitHub  , randomly selecting from the 68 ,949 GitHub users who had made at least one contribution in the previous twelve months  , used Java in at least one of their projects  , and had published their email address.In this section we present descriptions of the GitHub setting  , our data collection procedures  , measure calculation  , and analysis technique. From this dataset  , we fit a statistical model that associates social and technical contribution measures with the likelihood of pull request acceptance.We then present an evaluation of the framework that aims to quantify the effort necessary to include novel annotators and datasets to the framework. We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.Similarly  , Mishne & de Rijke 8 showed a strong link between blog searches and recent news -indeed almost 20% of searches for blogs were news-related. A poll by Technorati found that 30% of bloggers considered that they were blogging about news-related topics 7.Citebase harvests OAI metadata records for papers in these archives  , as well as extracting the references from each paper. 1  , allows users to find research papers stored in open access  , OAI-compliant archives -currently arXiv http://arxiv.org/  , CogPrints http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/ and BioMed Central http://www.biomedcentral.com/.Orkut is a general purpose social network. In this social network the friendship connections edges are directed.They found the cosine similarity measure to show the best empirical results against other measures. 5 present an empirical comparison of six measures of similarity for recommending communities to members of the Orkut social network.The by-author ranking is calculated as the mean number of citations or hits to an author e.g. After generating a search  , Citebase allows the results to be ranked by 6 criteria: citations to the article or authors  , Web hits to the article or authors  , date of creation  , and last update.The snapshot of the Orkut network was published by Mislove et al. It is a graph  , where each user corresponds to a vertex and each user-to-user connection is an edge.Part of it reflects the ease with which computers can drown inexperienced users in material: for example  , of undergraduate searches on the University of California online catalog  , MELVYL  , those that retrieve any titles at all retrieve an average of 400. Part of this reflects the difficulty of searching in general  , particularly   , as mentioned above  , using Chemical A bstnrcts without adequate experience or training.The input to the job is METS documents retrieved from the DOMS repository using the Stager on top of the SCAPE DOMS connector. The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .Finally  , we look at Peetz et al's classification of the Blog06- 08 topics 850-1050. This again suggests that the distribution of relevant documents played an important role in the determination of topic temporality.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems. In the context of the project ELVIRA  , a tool for generating statistical correlation relations based on parallel corpora was implemented.This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities. In our dataset  , most pull requests 84.73% are eventually merged.We have also made the code available for analyzing and benchmarking the profiles. We have implemented a URI-Key Generator  , more than one CDX Profiler  , and a script to merge profiles and published the code on GitHub 3 .Note that in all the results reported  , mentions that contain NIL or empty ground truth entities are discarded before the evaluation; this decision is taken as well in Gerbil version 1.1.4. Let M * be the ground truth entity annotations associated with a given set of mentions X.The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation. The first part is conducted on an Orkut community data set to evaluate the recommendation quality of LDA and ARM using top-k recommendations metric.Despite the large number of repositories hosted at GitHub  , developers work only on a consistently smaller fraction of them. 6Some of the top-ranked posts discuss the relationship of human capital and ICT-related developments. The selected EconStor article and its related blog posts show a meaningful relationship.However  , Sindice search results may change due to dynamic indexing. One option was to use Sindice for dynamic querying.We compare the similarity of articles that share tags to clusters of randomly-selected articles and also to clusters of articles that share most-relevant keywords  , as determined using TFIDF. We examine blog entries indexed by Technorati and compare the similarity of articles that share tags to determine whether articles that have the same tags actually contain similar content.GERBIL is an opensource and extensible framework that allows evaluating tools against currently 9 different annotators on 11 different datasets within 6 different experiment types. In this paper  , we present GERBIL – a general entity annotator benchmark –  , a community-driven effort to enable the continuous evaluation of annotation tools.The positive contribution of answers from blog documents to the various component scores was likely depressed due to the nature of the questions asked. In the end  , only 15.0% 54/360 of the factoid questions had an answer that could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; 24.8% 235/946 of the distinct items answering a list question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; and at most 6.1% 45/735 of the distinct nuggets answering an Other question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus.We extract a set of tourist attractions in the metadata of OpenStreetMap. A large value of F1 measure indicates a better clustering.Tables 2This is interesting because the principal metric used to rank blogs has been inlink count for example see the Technorati Top 100 5 or BlogPulse's Daily Top Blogs 6 . We argue that conversation mass is another important feature that is not necessarily correlated with in-links.However  , users cannot understand " what the resource is about " without opening and investigating the LOD resource itself  , since the resource title or example triples about the resource are not informative enough. Current WoD search engines and mechanisms  , such as Sindice 2 and Watson 3  , utilize full-text retrieval  , where they present a list of search results in decreasing relevance.Orkut: This graph represents the Orkut social network. We consider better  , in terms of quality  , those algorithms that have better matching with the gold standard  , independently of the type of algorithm under consideration.It extends SCOVO 10 with the ability to explicitly describe the structure of the data and distinguishes between dimensions  , attributes and measures. Data Cube model is compatible with SDMX – an ISO standard for sharing and exchanging statistical data and metadata.We picked all projects that we could retrieve given the Github API  , and selected from these only based on constraints of building and testing. Threats due to sampling bias: To ensure representativeness of our samples  , we opted to use search results from the Github repository of Java projects that use the Maven build system.Citebase  , more fully described by Hitchcock et al. The usage impact is an estimate of the number of downloads of that article so far available for one arXiv.org mirror only.One of the difficulties of applying ontology technology in this way has been the absence of appropriate tools for generating appropriate ontological annotations. More recently  , there has been great interest in the application of ontological technologies  , particularly since the advent of the Gene Ontology 2  , which has been widely adopted.In our survey  , we included an additional question asking why participants contribute to the chosen project. Indeed  , various developers discuss whether 1  , 50 or not 8  GitHub profiles should be the new de facto CV for developers .Our dataset includes various types of events performed by users on public repositories or following events between users i.e.  , when a user starts following another user. In this paper  , we analyze events that happened on GitHub over a period of 18 months  , between March 11  , 2012 and September 11  , 2013  , retrieved from that archive.Orkut is a large social networking website.  Orkut.For our empirical analysis  , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012. The stream-based approach is also applicable to the full data crawls of D Datahub ,It only requires UMBEL categorizations  , which can be achieved by number of methods such as the fuzzy retrieval model 8. iv Our approach is adaptable and can be plugged on top of any Linked Data search engine; in this paper  , we use Sindice 1.com/ViDA-NYU/user-agent-study. The URLs used in the experiment  , source code and response headers of all requests are available at https://github.Synonyms are the first type of words for which the TSA method seems to outperform the ESA method. Table 12presents additional examples of pairs belonging to these relations and the ranking of human judgments  , ESA and TSA algorithms for the WS-353 dataset.Baker analyzed 1 ,000 JavaScript source code snippets and 4 ,000 Java source code snippets. We augmented these by pulling from a few repositories on GitHub that were aimed at collecting source code examples.It is one example of how novel technology benefits programmers  , and it empowers them; GitHub's platform is responsible for the inception of many projects  , that otherwise wouldn't have existed 34. The features and usability provided by GitHub play a big role 34.The survey participants reported development experience was 17.2 years on average median 15; range 7 to 40  , while their GitHub experience was 5.9 years on average median 6; range less than 1 to since GitHub was founded. We iterated through the open-ended responses using grounded theory methods 12  , to categorize them and identify themes.A GitHub-wide acceptance process definition and enforcement mechanism might be beneficial to both integrators and contributors and might deter one-off  , low-quality contributions. In addition  , experienced contributors are used to searching for PR process documents  , though such policy documents are often not present in smaller projects.To evaluate TagAssist  , we used data provided to use by Technorati  , a leading authority in blog search and aggregation. The judges were asked to read each post and then check the boxes next to tags they thought were appropriate for the post.Furthermore  , the extended ontology includes the mappings resulted by the schema matching. The spatial data is collected by the OpenStreetMap 5 project and it is available in RDF format.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods. Latent Semantic Indexing and linguistic e.g.Pull Requests in Github. An overview of the pull request process can be seen in Figure 1.The report found that " Citebase can be used simply and reliably for resource discovery. This was used both to evaluate the outcomes of the project  , and to help guide the future direction of Citebase as an ongoing service.Further  , the samples came from a single repository Github  , and are all open source projects. Finally  , our findings are restricted to projects using the Java language  , the Maven framework  , and a standard project layout.The comparison results of TSA on the WS-353 dataset are reported in Table 1. Again  , TSA performs substantially better than ESA  , confirming that temporal information is useful on other datasets.By integrating such a large number of datasets  , experiment types and frameworks  , GERBIL allows users to evaluate their tools against other semantic entity annotation systems short: entity annotation systems by using exactly the same setting  , leading to fair comparisons based on exactly the same measures . GERBIL is an opensource and extensible framework that allows evaluating tools against currently 9 different annotators on 11 different datasets within 6 different experiment types.Figure 1: Number of events detected in the GitHub stream. Each event  , regardless of its kind  , usually includes some metadata about the entities involved e.g.  , the profile information of a user  , his or her number of followers  , the language of a repository   , etc.To answer our research questions  , we created and analyzed a dataset from the social open source software hosting site GitHub 12. In this section we present descriptions of the GitHub setting  , our data collection procedures  , measure calculation  , and analysis technique.This ensures that users can access the resource itself. Harvested metadata that has no corresponding digital resource is not indexed in OAIster.Examples of Web of Data search engines 7 and lookup indexes are Falcons  , Sindice  , Swoogle and Watson. Examples of Linked Data browsers 6 are Tabulator  , Disco  , the OpenLink data browser and the Zitgist browser.We sent them an email if their address was registered with GitHub and if they were not integrators in the same repository; we collected 4 ,617 emails. For each repository  , we extracted the top 3 pull request contributors by the number of PRs they contributed.Awareness. They might  , however  , rely on subtle social signals that environments like GitHub provide  , without realizing it.At the time of writing  , the CORE harvesting system has been tested on 142 Open Access repositories from the UK. The fact that CORE caches the actual full-text content in order to process the documents and to discover additional metadata distinguishes this approach from a number of other Open Access federated search systems  , such as BASE or OAISTER  , that rely only on the metadata accessible through OAI-PMH.We use open coding a grounded theory tool to come up with an inclusive set of reasons of why pull requests are not merged as follows: the first author read the pull request discussion on Github for randomly selected pull requests and summarized the reasons for closing them into one sentence per sample; during a second pass  , the descriptions were aggregated and codes were extracted . RQ4 To examine why some pull requests are not merged  , we qualitatively analyze a set of randomly chosen non-merged pull requests in depth.We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and  , for each of these articles  , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score. As a first step towards providing tools that will assist users in effectively tagging articles  , we tested the similarity of articles that contained similar keywords.Since our system only dealt with english language opinions it made no sense to keep the non english ones. The Blog06 dataset also contained a lot of non-english blogs.Already  , we are working with members of the W3C Linking Open Drug Data LODD to add their code to this GitHub repository  , identify and select an open source license  , and improve the linking of Bio2RDF data. First  , the consolidation of scripts into a single GitHub repository will make it easier for the community to report problems  , contribute code fixes  , or contribute new scripts to add more data into the Bio2RDF network of linked data for the life sciences.In our subject metadata enrichment experiments  , we used three of the fifteen Dublin Core elements: Title  , Subject and Description. The metadata OAIster collects is in Simple Dublin Core format.Whenever the need arises to more explicitly declare what kind of range is intended  , this technique can be used e.g. The earlier can be used to capture more information pertaining to the creation of a particular statistical item; – Defining sub-properties of using SCOVO-min and max.This model is easily extensible by defining new factors and agents pertaining to the actual statistical data. Dimensions of a statistical item are factors of the corresponding events  , attached through the dimension property  , pointing to an instance of the SCOVO Dimension class.We can see our re-ranking procedure successfully rescores almost all the target documents into the top 100 results. Table 3gives detailed descriptions of two topics in blog06 and blog07.In this paper we have analyzed the events happening on GitHub  , the most popular repository for open source code  , for 18 months between March 11  , 2012 and September 11  , 2013. We think that this might represent a starting point for the development of novel strategies and tools for supporting online collaboration more effectively and efficiently.These  , for instance  , are an indicator for available source code. Segments in curly brackets denote whole URLs that match predefined URL patterns   , such as GitHub URLs as denoted by {github}.The online version of GERBIL can be accessed at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil. More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.Thereafter  , we present the GERBIL framework. We begin by giving an overview of related work.Moreover   , partial results are not considered within the evaluation. To address this problem  , we aim to develop/implement novel measures into GERBIL that make use of scores e.g.  , Mean Reciprocal Rank.The most frequently occurring tag is " Weblog " with 6 ,695 ,762 occurrences. A sample of English blog data provided by Technorati from a 16 day period in late 2006 shows nearly 403 ,000 unique tags with a mean frequency of 343.1  , median of 8  , and mode of 1.Selecting word pairs to evaluate: To create a balanced dataset of both related words and unrelated words  , we applied the following procedure: Let W be a set of all words in the New York Times news articles. The relatedness of these pairs of words is then evaluated using human annotators   , as done in the WS-353 dataset.The full set of queries is available in the Github repository  , and additional information about the experiments can be found there as well 6 . We have taken the SRBench queries and adapted them according to our extended ontology.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al. We use GitHub as an example of a new class of transparent software environments that incorporate social media features to make work more visible.The query translation types supported by Morph are the na¨ıvena¨ıve translation queries C  , which are the result of the query rewriting algorithm described in Section 3  , together with three variants of it; with subquery elimination SQE  , self-join elimination SJE  , and both types of eliminations SQE+SJE. Our query translation algorithm has been implemented in our latest version of Morph  , which is available as a Java/Scala opensource project in Github 9 .Overall  , our approach attains the best averaged F1 value of all systems. The corresponding GERBIL result sheet is available on the GERBIL website 4 and can be used to make comparisons to our approach in future evaluations.Experimental results over Blog06 collection showed the advantage of using multiple opinion query positions in comparing the opinion score of documents. OWA operator was used as an aggregator in our system.Step i uses the CKAN API to extract dataset metadata for datasets part of the LOD-Cloud group in DataHub. The main steps shown in Figure 1are the following: i dataset metadata extraction from DataHub; ii resource type and instance extraction; iii entity and topic extraction; iv topic filtering and ranking; and v dataset profile representation.One of our participants  , an 18-year-old student  , was not only technologically-savvy in terms of adopting new websites and exploring advanced features of computer applications  , she was also a strong " gifter. " One reason for the ubiquity of Orkut is most likely due to the power of influencers and the practice of account gifting.Controls for changes in developer experience with time  , that may have affected individual productivity. To ensure compliance with lmer's modeling assumptions  , we also checked the QQ-plot for our model  , which showed good match with a normal of the current week  , relative to one's first ever recorded GitHub contribution .Informed by previous work  , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub. We also examine new software development environments that make use of transparency and social media features  , which sheds light on the kinds of signals that are visible and the inferences developers make.For example   , BLOG06-feed-000017 is associated with no permalinks in 20051206/feeds-000.gz according to <PERMALINKS> tags  , but the feed actually contains several permalinks  , such as Http://www.MacHall.Com ?strip id=357. To investigate the problem  , we closely looked at the blog06 corpus and found that many permalink URLs were not properly extracted from the corresponding feed files.Note that our definition of project as a collection of repositories owned by the same GitHub user is broader than the definition of project as a main repository together with all its forks  , proposed in the literature 25. The resulting aggregation of this data  , using our conceptualization of a project  , depicted in the right part of Figure 1  , shows contributions to only 4 projects.It is arguably less costly to switch between such related repositories in terms of context switches than other  , less related repositories on GitHub. 1 Such repositories are conceptually and technically related  , or even interde- pendent 7.JavaScript has been the lingua franca of client-side web development for some years. JavaScript has been selected as the most popular programming language for three consecutive years 42 and it is the most used language on GitHub 23.Besides  , we also plot the minimum bounding rectangles MBRs of tourist attractions for reference  , where the tourist attractions are collected from the metadata of OpenStreetMap. For the ease of presentation   , we highlight the clusters by different colors such that the size and shape of the clusters are clearly illustrated in the figures.Our approach can be plugged on top of any LOD search engine currently using Sindice search API. Using the input queries  , the WoD is searched.From an initial 1  , 800 projects  , we eliminated aggregate projects  , and projects without test suites  , which left us with 796 projects. We chose a large random sample of Java projects from Github 22 9 and the Apache Software Foundation 6 that use the popular Maven 7 build system.However  , the annotation requires trained human experts with extensive domain knowledge. To remedy this problem  , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph  , called Gene Ontology GO terms  , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.After receiving results  , our system augments the results with UMBEL categorizations  , which can be performed offline or dynamically 9. Our approach can be plugged on top of any LOD search engine currently using Sindice search API.In the following  , we present current state-of-the-art approaches both available or unavailable in GERBIL. Currently  , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features  , capabilities and experiments.In Section 7.2 we discuss our results in contrast to other works that are not publicly available. In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.Primarily a user-service  , Citebase provides a Web site that allows users to perform a meta-search title  , author etc. It was shown tasks can be accomplished efficiently with Citebase regardless of the background of the user. "Future research may investigate how developers use signals in other work environments  , transparent or not. Our findings inform how software developers and project managers make use of information in social work environments such as GitHub and imply a variety of ways that social features in work environments can support software development.With the advent of social coding tools like GitHub  , this has intensified. In open-source software  , developers also commonly contribute to multiple projects in the same time period  , bridging different communities 20  , 30.A poll by Technorati found that 30% of bloggers considered that they were blogging about news-related topics 7. USA elections  , China earthquake  , etc.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 . OpenStreetMap OSM maintains a global editable map that depends on users to provide the information needed for its improvement and evolution.Recently  , an approximate index structure for summarizing the content of Linked Data sources has been proposed by Harth et al. Swoogle 8  , Sindice 23 and Watson 7  among the most successful.The task was to identify documents that are relevant to these categories  , using a classifier trained on the labeled data. It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories  , including alleles of mutant phenotypes  , embryologic gene expression  , tumor biology  , and gene ontology GO annotation.14 The code used to create the LOTUS index is also publicly available. Code of the API functions and data from our experiments can be found on github.It consists of almost 20 million nodes vectors and 2 billion links non-zero weights  , yielding roughly . The Orkut graph is undirected since friendship is treated as a symmetric relationship.In particular  , OpenStreetMap OSM is an initiative for crowdsourcing map information from users. In conjunction with the widespread use of smartphones and GPS enabled devices  , this has resulted in a large number of RDF datasets containing geospatial information  , which is of high importance in several application scenarios  , such as navigation  , tourism  , and location-based social media.Any Github user can participate in the discussion of any pull request. Projects that employ code reviews feature larger code bases and bigger team sizes than those that do not.For this dataset  , we also gathered information about each unique GitHub user associated with the set of pull requests. In total  , this includes 659 ,501 pull requests across the 12 ,482 projects.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process  , cellular component and molecular function. The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes.Because of this convenience and extensibility  , we have also recently launched Coagmento 2.0 on GitHub as an open source tool 4 . Any computer with PHP  , Laravel  , Node.js and a SQL database could be a Coagmento 2.0 server.All figures are generated by our modified version of Java OpenStreetMap Editor 2 which is a map editor for OpenStreetMap 3 written in Java. The detail of our data preparation can be found in Section 6.Researchers can install PHP  , Laravel  , Node.js  , and a SQL framework and download the GitHub repository to get started with their instance of Coagmento. Because of this convenience and extensibility  , we have also recently launched Coagmento 2.0 on GitHub as an open source tool 4 .Dabbish et.al 10  found that Github's transparency helps developers manage their projects  , handle dependencies more effectively  , reduce communication needs  , and decide what requires their attention . Recently  , Github has been the target of numerous publications.As a result  , we create a wider author profile enriched with additional information. For each EconStor author  , we harvest several other repositories for correlations with other authors  , publications or other relevant information about the initial author.for each date  , we generate different topics that have been discussed on each day. Table 3shows the result of re-ranking the baselines with the MI weight of terms in the Blog06 collection and the second method in which we used an opinion lexicon.Finally we also employ the OKKAM service. If the resource descriptions includes OWL inverse functional properties IFPs from a hardcoded list e.g.  , foaf:mbox and foaf:homepage  , then a Sindice index search for other resources having the same IFP value is performed.5 present an empirical comparison of six measures of similarity for recommending communities to members of the Orkut social network. Spertus et al.We found that contributors have a strong interest in staying aware of project status to get inspiration and to avoid duplicating work  , but they do not actively try to propagate information about the pull requests they are preparing. Since GitHub hosts diverse projects developed by many different programmers  , it gives us the opportunity to learn from a variety of cases.We separate total running time into three parts: computation time  , communication time and synchronization time. In Table 9we report the speedup on the Orkut data set.For all these reasons  , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source. In fact  , GitHub is not simply offering a code hosting service  , like its competitors had been doing for a long time  , but also an easy-to-use and cheap or even free in its basic version online tool for collaborative software development and many features supporting the community of developers.For each query  , the returned top 1 ,000 documents are re-ranked according to the score consisting of the topic relevance and the opinion sentiment strength. Such hierarchical sentiment analysis model is applied to the whole Blog06 corpus to generate an opinion polarity judgment list for all the documents  , combined with the corresponding sentiment strength within interval 0  , 1.This functionality is only possible if we have reliable  , consistent and appropriate subject metadata for each of the ten million records in OAIster. We would like to improve the search and discovery experience on OAIster by allowing users to restrict search results by subject.Moreover  , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL. This result in itself is of high practical significance as it means that by using GERBIL  , developers can evaluate on currently 11 datasets using the same effort they needed for 1  , which is a gain of more than 1100%.It is a graph  , where each user corresponds to a vertex and each user-to-user connection is an edge. Orkut is a large social networking website.It is possible to express SCOVO in OWL-DL  , if advanced reasoning is of necessity. 2  is currently defined in RDF- Schema.While the GO is not an ontology in the purists' sense  , it is a large  , controlled vocabulary based on three axes or hierarchies:  Molecular function -the activity of the gene product at the molecular biochemical level  , e.g. To facilitate this  , the research community has come together to develop the Gene Ontology GO  , www.geneontology.org 3.To obtain references to the roots of the static view entities  , the GHTorrent project follows the event stream. The Github API data come in two forms; a streaming data flow lists events  , such as forking or creating pull requests  , happening on repositories in real time  , while a static view contains the current state of entities.Sindice is a offers a platform to index  , search and query documents with semantic markup in the web. Sig.ma20 is an entity search tool that uses Sindice11 to extract all related facts for a given entity.Some prolific developers are even considered "coding rockstars" by the overall community 5. Members of the GitHub community regard certain members as being at a higher standing.As a result a list of all publications  , co-authors and co-author's publications from our repository will be created and returned to the user of our prototype. Kubler  , Felix "   , in EconStor.Furthermore  , according to global OpenStreetMap statistics 1   , Italy and UK are ranked 7th and 10th for number of created spatial objects  , and 4th and 5th for density of created spatial objects per square kilometer. Since we decided to focus on Milano and London  , however  , we can discard this potential issue: our direct knowledge of the city of Milano let us affirm that the spatial objects mapping is quite good and homogeneous throughout the city; OpenStreetMap coverage in the London area was evaluated in 18 and shown to be quite accurate in comparison to official sources.The statistics of title keyterms in the MELVYL-database are typical of many bibliographic databases  , and a similar a7.nalysis and approach can be used to develop es- timators for other predicate types such as term IN SUBJECT-KEYTERMS. This section describes the construction of an extremely accurate estimator for predica.tes of the form term IN TITLE-KEYTERMS as au example of the applicability of user-defined predicate selectivity estimators.We have obtained information about 2.19 million users and 5.68 million repositories. In this paper we have analyzed the events happening on GitHub  , the most popular repository for open source code  , for 18 months between March 11  , 2012 and September 11  , 2013.On a similar note  , in the case of multiple ontologies  , i.e.  , when one ontology imports Figure 4: The class gene-part is unsatisfiable on two counts: its defined as an intersection of an unsatisfiable class dna-part and an unsatisfiable class expression ∃partof.gene  , both highlighted using red tinted icons. In the future  , we plan to extend this feature by displaying the reasoning chain for the simple  , yet non-trivial inferences by pointing to related definitions and axioms e.g.  , C is an intersection of D ,. implies C is a subclass of D  , but for now  , simply highlighting them separately is useful to the ontology modeler as they can potentially point to unintended assertions.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project. Since our analysis focuses on multitasking across projects  , we need to conceptualize how we define the boundaries of a software project.We report on instrumentation overhead and on the number of times that the same crash needs to be encountered to recover the complete crash path. We implemented the technique using Jalangi 28  , and evaluated it on crashing executions of JavaScript applications available from GitHub.OAIster's reach often goes beyond that of major web search engines. OAIster has built a unique collection of over ten million records.1 Such repositories are conceptually and technically related  , or even interde- pendent 7. However  , we observed that in some cases  , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.At the end of 2012  , GitHub hosted over 4.6M repositories. Over the last couple of years GitHub 4   , which is the most popular repository hosting service for Git projects  , has taken the open source community by storm 19.We split the data into training and test sets with approximately 9000 users in each. Perhaps because of the density  , and/or because the continuous scale introduces less quantization error in ratings  , Jester exhibits lower NMAE values than the other datasets we tested.However  , in the environment of GitHub  , which is both transparent and equipped with social media functionality  , we also expect contributors to make use of the social connections that the environment makes salient. From conventional wisdom on open source software projects  , we expect to see some evidence for a "meritocracy"  , in that technical contribution norms should reign over other signals when considering contributions 26.The CDX files required by ArchiveSpark were generated using the Internet Archive's CDX Generator  , which is available open source on GitHub 15 . HBase: Using Warcbase's ingestion tool For both ArchiveSpark and pure Spark approach  , WARC files from the collection were stored in Hadoop HDFS.These systems return flat lists of ontologies where ontologies are treated as if they were independent from each other while  , in reality  , they are implicitly related. Our view is that one of the issues hampering efficient ontology search is that the results generated by SWSEs  , such as Watson http://watson.kmi.open.ac.uk  , Swoogle http://swoogle.umbc.edu or Sindice http://sindice.com  , are not structured appropriately.We further refined the selection using the GitHub API to retrieve more detailed information about each repository with the following criteria: This selection included 185 ,342 repositories.Pull requests are enabled by default on all repositories opened on Github; however  , not all projects are using them to collaborate. In the GHTorrent dataset  , less than half 1 ,877 ,660 or 45% of the active repositories are original repositories.OAIster can be found online at http://www.oaister.org/  , with over a million records available from over 140 institutions. This ensures that users can access the resource itself.After eliminating projects aggregating multiple projects which are difficult to properly analyze  , a set of 1 ,254 projects remained. The process used by Github to select projects is not public  , but we believe it is orthogonal to our concerns  , and likely based on popularity and recency.We may note that not all forms of data are equally useful for presenting to the user  , including the most popular tagging microformat originally invented for giving hints to the Technorati search engine for categorizing blog posts. tagging are not necessarily the ones appearing on pages that are most searched for.It is based on a large and active community contributing both data and tools that facilitate the constant enrichment and enhancement of OSM maps. In particular  , OpenStreetMap OSM is an initiative for crowdsourcing map information from users.Examples for collaborative ontology engineering are the development processes of the AGROVOC thesaurus 3 or the Gene Ontology 4 . During the discussion  , it may be necessary to ask the issue creator for further clarification or for commenting on the proposed solutions.To answer these research questions  , we conduct an empirical investigation consisting of four separate studies. In Study 3 S3  , we analyze 100 randomly selected public GitHub repositories that use Java'sHowever  , LOTUS differs from these previous approaches in three ways: 1 its scale its index is about 100 times bigger than Sindice's was  , 2 the adaptability of its algorithms and data collection  , and 3 its integration with a novel Linked Data publishing and consumption ecosystem that does not depend on IRI dereferenceability. Centralized text search on the LOD Cloud is not new as Sindice 3 and LOD Cache 4 show.The six evaluation measures offered by GERBIL as well as the error count are expressed as qb:Measures. Each observation features the qb:Dimensions experiment type  , matching type  , annotator   , corpus  , and time.However  , in such a process  , many misleading words may also be extracted. One option is to extract all lexical information from the URI  , labels  , properties and property values of the LOD resources that are retrieved by Sindice search.To do this the pipe needs to execute a Sindice 19 query which will return a set of documents likely containing the description of messages left by the user on possibly multiple Web sites. Case 3: SIOC Aggregation RSS feed Given a SHA1 a user's email  , the output is a list of messages that the user left on the internet in sites that expose SIOC 8 data.Table 2 shows the statistics of our test corpora. All data sets are integrated in GERBIL and strongly differ in document length and amount of entities per docu- ment.GER- BIL will regularly check whether new corpora are available and publish them for benchmarking after a manual quality assurance cycle which ensures their usability for the implemented configuration options. However  , GERBIL is currently only importing already available datasets.One could argue that the the conversation mass metric is a better proxy for measuring influence. Tables 2This is interesting because the principal metric used to rank blogs has been inlink count for example see the Technorati Top 100 5 or BlogPulse's Daily Top Blogs 6 .Formal releases of these two broswers are expected to fix these problems. All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.Code is another prominent example of revisioned content  , and one that is becoming common on the web  , thanks to the success of sites like GitHub  , where users can share their code repositories. present  , but not directly exposed to the viewer.In analyzing the runtime speedup for parallel LDA  , we trained LDA with 150 topics and 500 iterations. To conduct our scalability experiments  , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.For instance  , iRefIndex consists of 13 datasets BIND  , BioGRID  , CORUM  , DIP  , HPRD  , InnateDB  , IntAct  , MatrixDB  , MINT  , MPact  , MPIDB  , MPPI and OPHID while NCBO's Bioportal collection currently consists of 100 OBO ontologies including ChEBI  , Protein Ontology and the Gene Ontology. R2 also includes 3 datasets that are themselves aggregates of datasets which are now available as one resource.This ontology now has approximately 17 ,000 terms and several million annotated instances. Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO  , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function  , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products.We selected our subject programs based on issues reported on GitHub. These more complex scenarios might require longer crash paths and make Crowdie more expensive to use  , but extra complexity will also make the partial instrumentation of Crowdie even more tractable compared to naive full instrumentation.It crawls the web continuously to index new documents and update the indexed ones. Sindice is a offers a platform to index  , search and query documents with semantic markup in the web.We use 5 drug-drug similarities Chemical-based  , Ligand-based  , Expression-based  , Side-effect-based  , and Annotation-based and 3 target-target Sequence-based  , Protein-based and Gene Ontology-based similarities  , obtained from Perlman et al. The dataset has 315 drugs  , 250 targets and 1306 interactions.Gene Ontology GO 1 is a system of keywords hierarchically organized as a directed acyclic graph with three main categories – biological process  , cellular component  , and molecular function. Afterwards  , this test instance SVM Training was sent to the trained SVM classifier to decide whether it is relevant or not.They found that integrators are most concerned with quality and prioritization. They conducted a tworound survey with 21 and 749 GitHub integrators on what factors they consider in their decision making process to accept or reject a pull request.4 The Organic Data Science Framework can be set up for different communities. The Organic Data Science Framework software is open source and is released on GitHub under an Apache 2.0 license.Orkut also offers friend relationship. Once a user joins orkut  , one can publish one's own profile  , upload photos  , and join communities of interest.As a developing service Citebase often needs to completely re-harvest its metadata  , and using a local mirror avoids repeatedly making very large requests to source archives. The Celestial mirror is used within Southampton by Citebase Search.Only 24 3% respondents added information using the 'other' field  , mostly providing clarifications. To ask respondents about their work habits before coding  , we provided them with a set of 7 questions based on our analysis of the literature and our vast GitHub experience with a 4-level Likert scale.can be reconstructed in a unique manner in future works. Hence  , by using GERBIL for experiments  , tool developers can ensure that the settings for their experiments measures  , datasets  , versions of the reference frameworks  , etc.This section describes a preliminary evaluation of the system and its approach. While the scores may seem low  , studies on Technorati data by Brooks 4 show cosineNew LOD resources are incrementally categorized and indexed at the server-side for a scalable performance 9. For example  , using a crawler and Sindice  , LOD resources can be categorized offline by the proposed fuzzy retrieval model 8  , or other clustering methods also UMBEL linked data mappings can be used.This is because for most classes T in the API framework  , GitHub contains many more usage samples than can be extracted from web pages. Structured call sequences are extracted from open-source projects on GitHub.We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework. Thereafter  , we present the GERBIL framework.For example  , users with lots of followers were treated as local celebrities. The number of followers a GitHub user possesses is used as a signal of standing 5 within the community.A standard search system for documents on the Blog06 collection using the Terrier search engine 3  was provided by the University of Glasgow to help the participating groups in creating their blog distillation topics. Each participating group has been asked to provide 6 or 7 topics along with some relevant feeds.However  , GERBIL is currently only importing already available datasets. 28 The extensibility of the datasets in GERBIL is furthermore ensured by allowing users to upload or use already available NIF datasets from DataHub.We present a principled method to create additional datasets  , as opposed to the WS-353 benchmark where the word pairs were extracted manually. As an effort to provide additional evaluation data in this problem domain  , we created a new dataset 1 to further evaluate our results upon.In the Table 5  , we present lists of movies in two exemplary interest-groups learnt for the MovieRating dataset. The personalization term P m|u in the active-selection Equation 7 consists of two terms  , P z|u  , the user-group mixing probabilities and P m|z  , the probability of getting a rating for a movie m in group z.Creating individual preprocessing rules for each repository in the collection is not a scalable solution for OAIster  , or any other large metadata collection. While our topic modeling approach is statistical  , and can handle some degree of noise  , we found that improved preprocessing of metadata records produced better results.Since the growth of documents in Sindice was closely related to upgrades in their technical infrastructure in the past  , we cannot reliably use their growth rate. It stores 37.72 million documents  , which accounts for slightly more than 0.1% of all WWW documents .The dataset as well as custom-built Ruby and R analysis tools are available on the Github repository gousiosg/pullreqs  , along with instructions on how to use them. Last but not least  , our dataset provides a rich body of information on open source software development.To account for potential measurement errors when matching social media data with streets  , we add a buffer of 22.5 meters around each street's polyline. To describe those segments  , we rely on data gathered and distributed for free by OpenStreetMap OSM a global group of volunteer cartographers who maintain free crowdsourced online maps and by Ordnance Survey the national mapping agency for Great Britain.Figure 1presents therapeutical targets HER1 and HER2 and annotations from the Gene Ontology GO 1 . Annotations encode domain knowledge required to precisely compute similarity between annotated concepts.Aggregated Search of Data and Services12 proposes to answer an SQL-like data query on XML datasets and RDBMS and propose relevant services to the latter. Both Sig.ma and Sindice are document-based and don't offer SWS discovery features or search for data using SWS.For larger distances  , the distribution increases again  , showing a big presence of intercontinental links. The sudden drop at x = 5000 km is due to the ocean separating North America and Europe  , that are the two regions where GitHub is mostly popular.Usage instructions and further information can be also found at http://LinkedGeoData.org. The dynamic of the OpenStreetMap project will ensure a steady growth of the dataset.In Jester  , users rate a core set of jokes  , and then receive recommendations about others that they should like. The Jester dataset comes from Ken Goldberg's joke recommendation website  , Jester 10.The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes. 2 decision on which vocabularies each article could be annotated with 3 the evidence on which the above decision is based.We can report that the SWSE Semantic Web Search Engine 4 will also soon be serving data obtained thanks to dumps downloaded using this extension. At consumer level and as discussed earlier  , the Sindice Semantic Web indexing engine adopts the protocol 3 and thanks to it has indexed  , as today  , more than 26 million RDF documents.The category of each community is defined on Orkut. The topic distributions of their Table 5: The community information for user Doe#1.The corresponding GERBIL result sheet is available on the GERBIL website 4 and can be used to make comparisons to our approach in future evaluations. Table 3 shows the F1 values in comparison to the competitor systems on all data sets.Currently  , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features  , capabilities and experiments. Furthermore  , we were not able to find a running webservice or source code for this approach.At consumer level and as discussed earlier  , the Sindice Semantic Web indexing engine adopts the protocol 3 and thanks to it has indexed  , as today  , more than 26 million RDF documents. Most large datasets provide a Semantic Sitemap and in general we report that data producers have been very keen to add one when requested given the very low overhead and the perceived lack of negative conse- quences.This set was actually derived from a larger set of 954 ,531 terms  , some of which cannot appear in user queries because they have been stoplisted but were partially indexed in the database prior to stoplisting  , or because they contain chnrncters t ,hat ca.nnot he entered by the user in The first parametric approach to selectivity estimn.tion was formalized in Selinger et al. The set D consists of the 951 ,008 different title keyterms that appeared in the MELVYL database as of December 12  , 1986.There were a wide range of deployed indexing and retrieval approaches for the blog distillation task. Interestingly  , CMU  , the top performing group  , experimented with both types of index  , and concluded that an index based on the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection leads to a better retrieval performance on this task.protein binding  Biological process -the biological activity carried out by the gene process  , e.g.  , cell differentiation  Cellular component -where in the cell the gene product functions  , e.g.  , the nucleus A major use of the GO has been to annotate the genomes of organisms used in biological research. While the GO is not an ontology in the purists' sense  , it is a large  , controlled vocabulary based on three axes or hierarchies:  Molecular function -the activity of the gene product at the molecular biochemical level  , e.g.It stores 37.72 million documents  , which accounts for slightly more than 0.1% of all WWW documents . The currently most complete index of Semantic Web data is probably Sindice 4 .Additionally  , several contributors fear that rejection of their PRs may harm their reputation. Some of our respondents also indicated that contributions to GitHub benefit their career growth e.g.  , " My contribution to projects allowed me to obtain a job within my favorite subjects " r437.Most participants were from North America or Europe. Having targeted only users of GitHub  , this was a surprising result.We also consider a simple variation on this idea by considering the percentage of pronouns in a blog  , assuming that personal blogs are likely to contain more personal pronouns than  , e.g.  , news or political blogs. OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger  , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API.Finally  , six applications were collected by searching GitHub for Fortran applications  , then selecting the ones that also contain C. Table 140. Nine applications were collected from a paper on global climate models 23.For the purposes of the blog distillation task  , the retrieval document units are documents from the feeds component of the Blog06 collection. Since there is no straightforward answer to this question  , we decided to suggest that the assessors read enough documents of the feed such that they are certain that the feed has a more than passing interest in the topic area  , and that they would be interested in subscribing to the feed in their RSS reader if they were interested in the topic area.We also performed test runs that calculated the performance measure Mean Reciprocal Rank MRR in addition to MAP during the " See also " evaluation. The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.For example  , contributions that introduced new features were expected to include tests. 23 found in their study of the testing culture in GitHub that project managers would demand that contributions include tests in certain cases.We recruited eight participants from GitHub  , randomly selecting from the 68 ,949 GitHub users who had made at least one contribution in the previous twelve months  , used Java in at least one of their projects  , and had published their email address. Duplicate sentences selected by more than one approach were only shown to participants once.To alleviate this problem  , GERBIL allows adding additional measures to evaluate the results of annotators regarding the heterogeneous landscape of gold standard datasets. At the moment  , those measures ignore NIL annotations   , i.e.  , if a gold standard dataset contains entities that are not contained in the target knowledge base K and an annotator detects the entity and links it to any URI  , emerging novel URI or NIL  , this will always result in a falsepositive evaluation.We noticed that some developers are interested in borrowing emerging technologies e.g.  , GitHub and bringing them to their own working environments. While pull-based development e.g.  , via GitHub is gaining popularity among distributed software development community  , the need to continue studying and supporting the evolution of large long-lived OSS projects remains as important as ever.We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work. We then present an evaluation of the framework that aims to quantify the effort necessary to include novel annotators and datasets to the framework.However  , our sample of programs could be biased by skew in the projects returned by Github. We picked all projects that we could retrieve given the Github API  , and selected from these only based on constraints of building and testing.Subsequently  , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub. This exploration is needed to guide future work in this area and led to our last research question: RQ2: What are the challenges of contributing in social coding sites using the pull-based development model ?Finally  , we offer our concluding remarks in Section 6. We present our parallelization framework of LDA in Section 4 and an empirical study on our Orkut data set in Section 5.As of August 2013  , Github reports more than 7 million repositories and 4 million users. Pull request usage is increasing in absolute numbers  , even though the proportion of repositories using pull requests has decreased slightly.When compared with the rankings determined by Technorati inlink counts  , the average pairwise Kenall tau correlation with human rankings was only 0.30. The average pairwise Kendall tau correlation of humans with the assigned credibility metric ranking was 0.45.The popularity of GitHub among developers living in the USA is really prominent  , as 3 users out of 10 are based there. 8 GitHub user profiles  , confirm this consideration.Also  , the infrastructure we used for the analysis is available open source as a GitHub repository 5. The list of repositories we used for our analysis is available online 11.For example  , Technorati 1 lists most frequently searched keywords and tags. This is why there has been a variety of efforts to extract information from blog articles.Human curators at MGI annotate genes and proteins with Gene Ontology GO codes based on evidence found in documents . The goal of the categorization task was to mimic activities performed by curators in the Mouse Genome Informatics MGI project 8.Bio2RDF dataset vocabularies and their SIO-mappings are stored in separate OWL ontologies on the bio2rdf-mapping GitHub repository 8 . rdfs:subClassOf  , owl:SubObjectPropertyOf.First  , wherever possible  , Citebase links each reference cited by a given article to the full-text of the article that it cites if it is in the database. Citation-navigation provides Web-links over the existing author-generated references.Conflicts can be resolved by either the contributor or a core team member; however  , pull request etiquette dictates that the contributor takes care of bringing the pull request back into a state where there are no conflicts. Github automatically detects conflicting pull requests and marks them as such.Blog search engines such as Technorati have introduced new features enabling people to find authoritative feeds on a given topic. A number of blog search engines and some hand-crafted directories try to provide a high quality index of feeds.Another observation  , also stated by this study  , is that compositionality indicates the existence of a semantic relation between terms. Our observation agrees with a recent study 18 of the Gene Ontology terms which proved that 63 ,5% of all terms in this domain are compositional in nature.Peterson 25  finds that open source software OSS development on Github works mostly similarly to traditional OSS development   , with the exception of faster turnaround times. Dabbish et.al 10  found that Github's transparency helps developers manage their projects  , handle dependencies more effectively  , reduce communication needs  , and decide what requires their attention .All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site. These browsers cover the most wellknown layout engines  , such as Trident and Gecko  , as well as several widely used JavaScript engines.The Github API data come in two forms; a streaming data flow lists events  , such as forking or creating pull requests  , happening on repositories in real time  , while a static view contains the current state of entities. We used Github data as provided through our GHTorrent project 16  , an off-line mirror of the data offered through the Github API.To further analyze the effectiveness of the proposed CRTER model  , out of the 550 test topics used in our experiments  , we conduct a case study on topic 867 on the Blog06 collection. However  , the average Cross Term's within document frequency in CRTER model of the relevant documents is clearly higher than the non-relevant ones  , indicating that our proposed CRTER model can effectively identify the relevant documents from the non-relevant ones for this topic.While these programs are widely used  , they may not be representative of all programs and likewise the reported bugs that we investigated may not be representative either. We selected our subject programs based on issues reported on GitHub.Detailed results are also provided 1112 . Results of the experiments run on the Gerbil platform are shown in Table 2.As our method also captures co-occurrences of words in a single article as we construct time-series aggregated over all articles on a certain date  , phrases can also be identified well. The rankings are based on the rank of the similarity of the pair of words out of the 353 pairs in the WS-353 dataset.Section 5.1 discusses criteria used to measure the quality of estimators. The statistics of title keyterms in the MELVYL-database are typical of many bibliographic databases  , and a similar a7.nalysis and approach can be used to develop es- timators for other predicate types such as term IN SUBJECT-KEYTERMS.First  , we seek a deeper understanding of multitasking and its effects for software developers active on GitHub. Our study was guided by two research questions.5 on GitHub  , we know that when core members evaluate pull requests  , they look for the inclusion of test cases as a signal of the thoroughness of the contribution. From the prior work of Dabbish et al.Further  , our ongoing work focuses on broadening the deployment base available 17   , making converters from and to SCOVO available  , and extending the framework itself. For example  , one part of the UN data set—the Commodity Trade Statistics Database COMTRADE—alone provides commodity trade data for all available countries and areas since 1962  , containing almost 1.1 billion records.Threats due to sampling bias: To ensure representativeness of our samples  , we opted to use search results from the Github repository of Java projects that use the Maven build system. While we have used 100 trials each for each observation  , the possibility of bias does exist.Other services can harvest this enhanced metadata from Citebase to provide a reference-linked environment  , or perform further analysis or they can be harvested by the source archives to enhance their own data. AMF encapsulates the relationships within the scholarly research: between authors  , articles  , organisations  , and publications.Given the full text of a scientific article   , a system should decide whether the article would support curation in each the following four categories: 1 Gene Ontology annotation The Gene Ontology Consortium  , 2000  , 2 the Mouse Tumor Biology Database 3 the Gene Expression Database  , and 4 the Alleles and Phenotypes category of the Mouse Genome Database. In this paper we describe the approaches we investigated in the course developing a  The Categorization task involves making the following decisions.Next to individual configurable experiments  , GERBIL offers an overview of recent experiment results belonging to the same experiment and matching type in the form of a Table 5: Results of an example experiment. Offering such detailed and structured experimental results opens new research avenues in terms of tool and dataset diagnostics to increase decision makers' ability to choose the right settings for the right use case.Harvested metadata that has no corresponding digital resource is not indexed in OAIster. The unique feature of OAIster is that it provides access to metadata pointing to actual digital resources.We analyzed development activity and perceptions of prolific GitHub developers. To answer our research questions  , we followed a mixedmethods approach characterized by a sequential explanatory strategy 15.While pull-based development e.g.  , via GitHub is gaining popularity among distributed software development community  , the need to continue studying and supporting the evolution of large long-lived OSS projects remains as important as ever. Most recent studies were either conducted at Microsoft 4 or focused on the pull-based development model 12.Researchers can follow the Laravel framework to create new Web pages for user interaction and define new data types e.g. Researchers can install PHP  , Laravel  , Node.js  , and a SQL framework and download the GitHub repository to get started with their instance of Coagmento.In both our question set and our interpretation of the results  , we avoided direct references to GitHub's implementation of the mechanism. While this model remains the same across all these sites and the social features are similar  , the implementation of several GitHub features might influence the developer's opinions of the model.In the case of GitHub  , external services are available to enable continuous integration e.g.  , Travis and code quality e.g.  , Code Climate monitoring on a per contribution basis. This can include code style compliance checks and perhaps more sophisticated static analysis tools.Hilliness. Its score depends on the number of shops  , bars  , restaurants  , and parks on the street extracted from OpenStreetMap and on the street's type.The novelty lays in the decoupling of the development effort from the decision to incorporate the results of the development in the code base. Pull requests as a distributed development model in general  , and as implemented by Github in particular  , form a new method for collaborating on distributed software development.To safeguard user privacy  , all user and community data were anonymized as performed in 17. Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.An exception is the Datahub data set D  , where the distribution of resources in type sets and property sets seems comparable. Similar observations can be made for the data set A  , F and G  , though to a lower extent.As previously explained  , a user follows other users in order to be regularly updated about events regarding them e.g.  , forks  , created repositories  , starred repositories  , and so on. In other words  , establishing links has high cost in GitHub  , as people do not " follow-back " unless they are professionally interested in the activity of their followers.A total of 45 ,995 blogs were identified by their homepage URL. We tested SugarCube on the Blog06 collection 5 .However  , we observed that in some cases  , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub. The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.More research is needed to explore options concerning process policies. A GitHub-wide acceptance process definition and enforcement mechanism might be beneficial to both integrators and contributors and might deter one-off  , low-quality contributions.Further developers were invited to complete the survey  , which is available at our project website . Moreover  , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.Usually  , the discussion occurs between core team members trying to understand the changes introduced by the pull request and community members often  , the pull request creator who explain it. Any Github user can participate in the discussion of any pull request.5 showed that developers are able to make a variety of subtle inferences about other developers and projects using the social media cues. Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.The earlier can be used to capture more information pertaining to the creation of a particular statistical item; – Defining sub-properties of using SCOVO-min and max. The latter is of particular help if an existing taxonomy or thesaurus is used as a base.Overall  , there are 492  , 104 communities withheld from Orkut data set one community withheld for each user. We set k to be 1001  , so that the number of random communities selected for ranking evaluation is 1000.To minimize this threat  , we use systems from different domain from Github and Apache  , having a substantial variation in age  , size and ratio of bugs to overall lines see table 1. External Validity concerns generalizability of our result.We present our parallelization framework of LDA in Section 4 and an empirical study on our Orkut data set in Section 5. In Section 3  , we show how ARM and LDA can be adapted for the community recommendation task.In GitHub a user can create code repositories and push code to them. GitHub is based on the Git revision control system 6 .How many of those small changes can be synthesized in an automated manner ? Let us have a look at any bug fix of less than 10 lines in a source code repository  , for instance on Github.In social networks  , a common measure of user popularity and influence is given by the in-degree Wasserman and Faust 1994 . Even if it is not possible to provide definitive evidence about that  , in the following we will show some interesting correlations between the activity of a user and some indirect rewards in terms of " social prestige " in GitHub.We asked users about their software development experience in general  , and with GitHub; which factors influence their contributing to new repositories; what makes them switch between projects; and their perceptions of the impacts of contributing to multiple projects. The survey included multiple choice  , Likert scale  , and open-ended questions.The paper is structured as follows: We motivate the need for a simple RDB-to-RDF mapping solution in Section 2 by comparing indicators for the growth of the Semantic Web with those for the Web. Additionally  , we employed Triplify to publish the 160GB of geo data collected by the OpenStreetMap project.With this work  , our goal is to deepen our understanding of how information in transparent open source software environments is used to evaluate contributions. GitHub is an example of a new class of work environment that offers greater transparency of work actions and social relationships.During this search  , we used the entity-document ED centric approach because we were interested in finding entity across multiple contexts 4  , 5. the Sindice dump for each entity candidate.While the results are based only on open source Java programs hosted on Github  , and using the popular Maven build system  , it is likely that our findings apply at minimum to many other Java projects  , and may well apply to other languages as well. This paper draws from the evaluation of hundreds of open source projects.We used the Github Archive database 4 to make a list of the most-watched Rails-associated repositories. Selecting Applications.Let M be the output annotations of an entity disambiguation system on the same input. Note that in all the results reported  , mentions that contain NIL or empty ground truth entities are discarded before the evaluation; this decision is taken as well in Gerbil version 1.1.4.These annotations explicitly describe properties of HER1 and HER2  , and state-of-the-art similarity measures like AnnSim 13 or DiShIn 4  , decide relatedness between HER1 and HER2 in terms of the similarity of these annotations. Figure 1presents therapeutical targets HER1 and HER2 and annotations from the Gene Ontology GO 1 .Our observation agrees with a recent study 18 of the Gene Ontology terms which proved that 63 ,5% of all terms in this domain are compositional in nature. We observed that many of the terms mentioned in the analyzed corpus expose a high level of compositionality  , in the sense that they incorporate other meaningful terms as proper substrings.We have proposed a vocabulary  , SCOVO  , and discussed good practice guidelines for publishing statistical data on the Web in this paper. When the data is present in a table with a certain layout  , it turns out to be advantageous to not only repurpose and link the data  , but also reuse the data table in the author's intended form.Figure 1illustrates the distribution of feed sizes in the corpus. The BLOG06 corpus contains feeds ranking in size from just 1 or 2 posts to feeds with several hun- dred.Cultural context may be a big reason why account gifting is more predominant in developing regions. She taught them how to upload pictures and leave scraps for each other  , and in this way  , was their gateway to Orkut.Deduction rules. This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.There are a number of future directions for this work. 4 Validation on new data sets  , such as the Jester data set 7 in progress.Besides metadata properties like titles  , descriptions and authors  , the source files of the open datasets themselves are linked as dcat:Distributions  , allowing Table 2: Datasets and their formats. GERBIL uses the recently proposed DataID 2 ontology that combines VoID 1 and DCAT 21  metadata with Prov- O 20 provenance information and ODRL 23  licenses to describe datasets.Citation-navigation provides Web-links over the existing author-generated references. As part of the development of Citebase we have looked at the relationship between citation impact  " how many times has this article been cited "  and web impact  " how many times has this article been read " .This enhancement enables a variety of new Linked Data applications such as geo data syndication or semantic-spatial searches. The publication of the OpenStreetMap data using Triplify adds a completely new dimension to the Data Web: spatial data can be retrieved and interlinked on an unprecedented level of granularity.Table 8provides details on the number of presumed splog posts which infiltrated each element of the relevance scale. The 17 ,958 splog feeds in the Blog06 collection generated 509 ,137 posts.However  , these algorithms can be integrated at any time as soon as their webservices are available. The AIDA annotator as well as the " Illinois Wikifier " will not be available in GERBIL since we restrict ourselves to webservices.JavaScript has been selected as the most popular programming language for three consecutive years 42 and it is the most used language on GitHub 23. Our results show that using Sahand helps developers perform program comprehension tasks three times more accurately. Number of reported bugs. 3 For client-side projects  , we select from the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.they display graph properties similar to measurements of other popular social networks such as Orkut 25. First  , our prior analysis 35  showed that they are representative of measured social graphs  , i.e.We can see that the performance on Blog-2008 is worse compared to Blog06 and Blog 07. In Table 13  , we show the MAP scores of our best runs on opinion finding and polarity tasks based on different datasets for comparison Blog06  , 07  , and 08.Table 2summarizes the most popular point-of-interest annotations currently found in the OpenStreetMap data. As a result  , we obtained 192 million pointsof-interest   , which are annotated with roughly 800 million property-value combinations.SPARQL endpoint from DataHub in step i  , step ii extracts resource types and instances via SPARQL queries 5 that conform to the definition of resource types and instances in Section 2. From the extracted dataset metadata i.e.At the TechCrunch event Realtime Stream Crunchup he announced that he would be joining BT to work together with JP Rangaswami. He became Principal Engineer for Technorati after working for both Apple and the BBC.This outcome confirms a similar result obtained with a different collection the Blog06 collection  , where we applied query expansion selecting the pseudo relevant set with time distribution over documents 4. Therefore we have proved that time can provide a uniform boosting of relevance.The nuggets extracted from the Blog06 corpus in the run Ephyra3 rarely contained relevant information on the target  , but often they were meaningless sentence fragments or not even natural language phrases. Ephyra1 and Ephyra2 were identical runs that restricted the search to the newswire text.The association between document records and references is the basis for a classical citation database. Citebase harvests OAI metadata records for papers in these archives  , as well as extracting the references from each paper.Such hierarchical sentiment analysis model is applied to the whole Blog06 corpus to generate an opinion polarity judgment list for all the documents  , combined with the corresponding sentiment strength within interval 0  , 1. MEDoc models judge and label such sequence.In contrast with the previous standard benchmark  , WS-353  , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below  , which eliminates subjective selection of words. Finally  , empirical evaluation shows that TSA exhibits superior performance compared to the previous state of the art method ESA  , and achieves higher correlation with human judgments on both datasets.Some of the more popular open source software projects that GitHub hosts include Ruby on Rails and jQuery. The site offers both free open source project hosting and paid private hosting and is home to over ten million repositories 1.In fact  , contributing to as many GitHub projects as possible is an accomplishment  , valued by peers and employers alike 32. It is not uncommon to find prolific developers contributing code to 5-10 GitHub projects in the same week.We then analyse Citebase's database  , and summarise the findings of a user survey conducted by the Open Citation Project 7. We introduce the Celestial tool 4 a cache/gateway for the OAI-PMH and Citebase 5 an end-user service that applies citation-analysis to existing OAI-PMH compliant eprint archives.The Jester dataset comes from Ken Goldberg's joke recommendation website  , Jester 10. The standard deviations in all estimates are less than 0.25 %.The framework aims at supporting people to publish their statistics on the Web of Data in an effective and efficient manner. We have proposed a vocabulary  , SCOVO  , and discussed good practice guidelines for publishing statistical data on the Web in this paper.Having targeted only users of GitHub  , this was a surprising result. Yet  , in our view  , the most relevant quality of our participants was that they were not only novice or hobby programmers  , but instead professional developers working in software companies .But still they are far from being a comprehensive platform for organizing all types of personal data. Some exceptions exist  , like BibSonomy 1 bookmarks + bibtex  , sevenload 2 pictures + video  , or technorati 3 blogs + video.We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation  , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction   , which is absent in many of the public datasets. These amount to roughly 100k transactions by 34k consumers on 30k products in the testing dataset.For recommender systems which present ranked lists of items to the user  , We computed the average error for Jester 2.0 algorithm across the It is difficult to compare its algorithm against existing ones due to the lack a standard performance metrics and the inherent difference in the nature of the data sets used for experimental analysis of different algorithms.We analysed the Blog06 collection using SugarCube. To our knowledge  , this is the first application of Percolation Theory in the quantification of propagation in Information Retrieval.Table 2also shows that  , compared with the total of all runs  , Pronto produced relatively few unsupported answers   , and relatively many locally correct answers. Our third run showed the best results  , which only differed from the second run by inclusion of the Blog06 documents.Considering all projects  , not just those hosted on GitHub  , our survey participants reported contributing to an average of 2.7 projects per day median 2; range 0–10. Still  , almost all developers 98%; 1 ,165 out of 1 ,193 contributed to multiple projects per day at least once.For the ease of presentation   , we highlight the clusters by different colors such that the size and shape of the clusters are clearly illustrated in the figures. All figures are generated by our modified version of Java OpenStreetMap Editor 2 which is a map editor for OpenStreetMap 3 written in Java.For merged pull requests  , an important property is the time required to process and merge them. This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.Respondents reported challenges regarding the tools and model less frequently. Without threading it can be hard to follow a conversation " r102   , " effectively communicating with other users over github " r329.Previous work has revealed that most GitHub repositories are inactive and have a single user 25  , 31 . Sampling projects and candidate respondents.Another direction for further research is to expand in such a way that new instances of concept C j can be added to the ontology  , whereas now  , only known instances can be part of a instantiated relation. which cities are located in a country and the biomedical domain which proteins interact with a gene.In Figure 4we present a representative set of Semantic Web vocabularies that are relevant for the desktop  , grouped by their application domain. Semantic search engines  , such as Sindice 14 and Swoogle 5  , or index sites for the Semantic Web 4 are good starting points to search for existing vocabularies.In this work we examined how social and technical information in the transparent open source software environment of GitHub is used to make contribution decisions. Our findings may also inform how project managers should change their evaluation policies based on what signals are important.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil. We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work.Pull requests and shared repositories are equally used among projects. RQ1: 14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github.The full list of public events that have happened on GitHub is available on the GitHub Archive website 8 . For our static analyses we consider these networks as they appear on the final day of the time window we take into con- sideration.Our findings inform how software developers and project managers make use of information in social work environments such as GitHub and imply a variety of ways that social features in work environments can support software development. Well-established projects were more conservative when evaluating pull requests  , perhaps due to audience pressures.We hypothesize that for a hybrid service like GitHub  , both a social network and a collaboration network  , some kind of indirect reward mechanism might and potentially underpin user activity. 2012.Jester provides a simple HTML client that allows any user having a computer with intemet connectivity and a browser supporting frames to access the system. Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.Using SCOVO in voiD allows a simple and extendable description of statistical information  , however  , a shortcoming has been identified: as scovo:Items are grouped into scovo:Datasets  , there is an implicit assumption that all items in such a dataset share the same dimensions. SCOVO is used in voiD  , the " Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets " 1  to express information about the number of triples  , resources and so forth.They might  , however  , rely on subtle social signals that environments like GitHub provide  , without realizing it. This situation raises questions about whether social features are useful to contributors.A main advantage of our work is that we do not rely on one source of information  , but rather combine three di↵erent sources SO  , GitHub projects  , and developer surveys. 26 that summarizes the techniques used in this area.Currently  , however  , each web service provider will generally use its own manner of representing data  , and  , in the absence of standards  , an alternative approach to automating service workflows is to make conversion programs — termed shims  , following 11  — available as web services like any other. In the ontology arena  , the Gene Ontology consortium has established a flat-file format for simple ontologies  , and is moving to a more flexible format the OBO format 5 .Currently  , only very few web-based tools use tables for representing Linked Data. As an example  , the popular Semantic Web search engine Sindice 8 is practically unusable for people without a deep understanding of semantic technologies.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project. As of April 2013  , the Medusa development team has implemented a functioning collection registry  , bit-level ingest feature  , and an object-level PREMIS packager.It is difficult to compare its algorithm against existing ones due to the lack a standard performance metrics and the inherent difference in the nature of the data sets used for experimental analysis of different algorithms. Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.The curve below shows how cross-validation NMAE varies with model size k and number of users m. To the left of the curve  , it is clear that high k leads to large errors  , implying that the model is over-fitting. For Jester  , which had a high density of available ratings  , the model was a 300-fold compression.Generating all recommendations for one user took 7 milliseconds on the same hardware as the previous experiment. For the Jester dataset with 100 items  , 9000 users and k = 14  , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.Furthermore  , the association of a gene with a function may change because of amendments to the functional characterization of genes: for example  , see 22 for a discussion of problems associated with gene and function nomenclature and association. The Gene Ontology is not the only controlled vocabulary used for this purpose  , nor is it used consistently for annotating different genomes.Traditional benchmark databases  , such as Wieconein and AS3AP  , are primarily geared toward8 performance assessment of the algorithm8 in relation to the architecture . The experiment8 foreseen require care in the design and population of the test databases.Figure 1plots the computed weight distribution for the MovieRating dataset given 100 training users. To better understand why our weighting scheme improves the performance of Pearson Correlation Coefficient method  , we first examine the distribution of weights for different movies.The front-end of Citebase is a meta-search engine. Other services can harvest this enhanced metadata from Citebase to provide a reference-linked environment  , or perform further analysis or they can be harvested by the source archives to enhance their own data.To describe those segments  , we rely on data gathered and distributed for free by OpenStreetMap OSM a global group of volunteer cartographers who maintain free crowdsourced online maps and by Ordnance Survey the national mapping agency for Great Britain. We consider the area of Central London  , which consists of 3 ,368 street segments.The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations. Projections.If our service returns a NIL annotation  , GERBIL treats it like " not annotated " . We note that the GERBIL version that we use does not consider NIL annotations when computing the F1  , recall and precision values.Citebase was developed as part of the JISC/NSF Open Citation Project  , which ended December 2002. Citebase contains 230 ,000 full-text eprint records  , and 6 million references of which 1 million are linked to the full-text.Finally we did filtering of offensive content. So In order to facilitate better classification  , we increased the dataset by manually annotating some splog in the Blog06 dataset itself.Github is currently the most popular repository for open source code and its transparent environment implies a suitable basis for evaluating reuse and collaboration among developers 21. The participants where selected from the community of Semantic Web SW developers on Github who have had at least one active SW-related repository.The goal of this work is to obtain a deep understanding of the pull-based software development model  , as used for many important open source projects hosted on Github. The dataset as well as custom-built Ruby and R analysis tools are available on the Github repository gousiosg/pullreqs  , along with instructions on how to use them.com/srinathsridhar/graph-matching-source Recall that the partition algorithm split the graph into multiple graphs and found matchings using an implementation of Hopcroft-Karp 13 in these smaller graphs which were then combined into a recommendation subgraph. The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.  , navigate the literature using linked citations and citation analysis  , and to retrieve linked full-texts in Adobe PDF format. Primarily a user-service  , Citebase provides a Web site that allows users to perform a meta-search title  , author etc.The spatial data is collected by the OpenStreetMap 5 project and it is available in RDF format. The goal of LinkedGeoData is to add a spatial dimension to the Semantic Web.Point annotations  , for example  , are originally stored as comma separated property-values assignments in a BLOB column within the database. In order to publish the OpenStreetMap data  , we performed some preprocessing of the data structures.For example  , impressions of general coding ability could be gleamed from the contents of a GitHub user's profile. 19 found that when GitHub developers engage in information-seeking behaviors  , they use signals in the environment to form impressions of users and projects.This hinders the effective discussion of high-level concerns e.g.  , system design and has a negative impact on the centralization of information about a contribution. A significant portion of both integrators and contributors find that the communication facilities afforded by the GitHub PR mechanism are lacking in terms of immediacy and structure.GitHub is also a popular code hosting site with a large user base that could provide a relatively diverse pool of potential participants. In previous work 13  , we were able to recruit such participants from GitHub 3 .The Wookieepedia collection provides two distinct quality taxonomies. These are the two Wikia encyclopedias with the largest number of articles evaluated by users regarding their quality.These repositories span several programming languages: Java  , C  , C++  , JavaScript  , and Python. We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.Since OpenStreetMap is a prominent example of volunteered geographic information VGI 7  , LinkedGeoData knowledge reflects the way in which the environment is experienced 8 . LinkedGeoData uses the information collected by the OpenStreetMap project with the aim of providing a rich integrated and interlinked geographic dataset for the Semantic Web.the usage of SCOVO  , let us assume we want to model airline on-time arrivals and departures. We note that the complete example  , including the exemplary queries in an executable form  , is available at http://purl.org/NET/scovoIn the following  , we present nine well-known and publicly available data sets which are integrated in GERBIL and are used in our evaluation. The reported results of our approach and competitive systems are based on this platform and serve as comparable results for future systems.26 examined the testing practices of projects on Github and found that the lower barriers to submission hinders high-quality testing as the work load on project member increases. Pham et al.These annotated datasets have created many opportunities for large scale Linked Data mining. For example  , the biomedical community has taken the lead in such activities; every model organism database has genes and proteins that are widely annotated using the Gene Ontology GO.The Orkut graph is undirected since friendship is treated as a symmetric relationship. A user's vector has a 1 in any dimension that represents himself or anyone the user has listed as a " friend. "We use Sindice Search API to search the WoD and Lucene for indexing/fuzzy retrieval model. Client-side personalization is also scalable and computationally efficient since the workload is distributed to the clients and network traffic is significantly reduced.There was a wide variance in the distribution of relevant feeds in the used 45 topics  , suggesting that the guidelines for the topic creation and assessments still require tightening for future iterations of this task. One of the issues that might need to be further investigated in this task is whether it is beneficial to use the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection  , instead of or in addition to the Permalinks component.The application of opinion modules is similar to on-topic retrieval optimization in that opinion scores generated by modules act as opinion reranking factors to boost the ranks of opinionated blogs in the topic-reranked results. We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.In the empirical study  , we selected 8 GitHub 5 Java projects that have been widely used in software testing research 23– 25 . As this empirical study is designed to investigate the influences of test addition  , the columns " Ft1 " and " Ft2 " presents the numbers of faults used for theThe survey included multiple choice  , Likert scale  , and open-ended questions. We sent an online survey to 851 GitHub users selected from the set of prolific developers described earlier.While there is clearly great utility in being able to group blog entries into general categories  , this presents a question: do tags provide users with the necessary descriptive power to successfully group articles into sets ? This can be seen from the popularity of Technorati tags such as " Baseball "   , " Blogs "   , " Fashion "   , " Funny "   , and so on.Lucene IR framework is utilized for indexing of concepts and at the implementation of the fuzzy retrieval model. In particular  , we use Sindice search for querying the WoD and Sindice Cache for retrieving RDF descriptions of LOD resources 2.6 A more traditional approach to query expansion using relevance feedback might also be beneficial. Some resources we considered using are the Gene Ontology  , the Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus   , and the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server.23 found in their study of the testing culture in GitHub that project managers would demand that contributions include tests in certain cases. Pham et al.On GitHub  , users can indicate whether they are available for hire: 80 respondents said they were for hire and 171 said they were not. The number of accounts people followed ranged from 0 to 2 ,600.Structured call sequences are extracted from open-source projects on GitHub. Using structured call sequences allows the synthesizer to generate code which covers the suggested APIs from the natural language to API mapper  , and at the same time  , obeys common coding conventions.The currently most complete index of Semantic Web data is probably Sindice 4 . We tried to relate this to the growth of the Semantic Web.5kudos to Andreas Langegger for the screen shot  , that generates statistics for datasets behind SPARQL-endpoints and RDF documents. Further  , we have gathered that SCOVO is used in the RDFStats framework 15   , see Fig.Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology FMA 10 or Gene Ontology 11 that can be used to structure processes with semantic information. In addition  , there are many ontologies i.e.3 For client-side projects  , we select from the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub. For node.js projects  , we select modules that are the most depended-on modules in the npm repository .In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL. link to a KB task.27 found that integrators struggle to maintain the quality of their projects. In a survey of integrators of busy projects in GitHub  , Gousios et al.Sindice  , Falcons and Hermes are formally evaluated over hundreds of millions of statements  , while Semplore is evaluated over tens of millions of statements. Existing systems operate on data collections of varying size.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications  , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites. In this paper  , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.Our empirical comparisons using the top-k recommendations metric show a surprisingly intuitive finding: that LDA performs consistently better than ARM for the community recommendation task when recommending a list of 4 or more communities.  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492  , 104 users and 118  , 002 communities.The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work. Moreover  , 6 novel annotators were added to the platform.Last community is the withheld community while the rest are joined communities. The category of each community is defined on Orkut.To assess word relatedness  , we use the WS-353 benchmark dataset  , available online 14  , which contains 353 word pairs. Evaluating word relatedness is a natural ability humans have and is  , therefore  , considered a common baseline.These words were then treated as the article's " autotags . " We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and  , for each of these articles  , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score.1  , allows users to find research papers stored in open access  , OAI-compliant archives -currently arXiv http://arxiv.org/  , CogPrints http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/ and BioMed Central http://www.biomedcentral.com/. Citebase  , more fully described by Hitchcock et al.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service  , Wookieepedia  , about the Starwars universe. In this article  , we refer to this sample as WPEDIA.26 To this end  , GERBIL implements a Java-based NIF 15 reader and writer module which enables loading arbitrary NIF document collections  , as well as the communication to NIF-based webservices. Moreover  , we capitalize upon the uptake of publicly available  , NIF based corpora over the last years 40  , 36.Also in this work  , time was shown to improve the performance of the first pass retrieval. This outcome confirms a similar result obtained with a different collection the Blog06 collection  , where we applied query expansion selecting the pseudo relevant set with time distribution over documents 4.From the Wikia service  , we selected the encyclopedias Wookieepedia  , about the Star Wars universe  , and Muppet  , about the TV series " The Muppet Show " . From now on  , we refer to this encyclopedia as WPEDIA.A paper was automatically assigned to its relevant GO contexts using a detailed and independently verified process 1  , 2 . For this paper set  , we utilized the Gene Ontology GO hierarchy as a context hierarchy 4  , 14.The classifier was trained on the Blog06 text collection first  , and then applied to the posts in the Blog08 text collection to estimate the probability of each post being relevant to the query. Each post was represented by a vector  , the components of which were binary values that indicated whether a word existed in the post or not.Social coding  , as performed on GitHub  , and cloud computing come to mind  , but other new ways to drive progress surely remain to be discovered. In addition  , the looming end of progress in semiconductor manufacturing driven by Moore's Law 35 means that corresponding advancement of software development practices based on its fruits will also stall; we will need to come up with other  , more frugal or different  , sources of innovation.Our experiment showed that SugarCube is successful in providing a method for quantifying the propagation of topics  , and also in identifying heavily percolated ones within the test collection. We analysed the Blog06 collection using SugarCube.We also used the API to gather information on all issues and comments for each repository. This set of user information includes 95 ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.We investigated the effort to implement a BAT-framework adapter in contrast to evaluation efforts done without a structured evaluation framework in Section 4. Due to the community effort behind GERBIL  , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9.One option was to use Sindice for dynamic querying. For non-adaptive baseline systems  , we used the same dataset.3  evaluated popular large scale ontologies such as SNOMED  , FMA  , and Gene Ontology and stated that " ontologies play an important role in biomedical research through a variety of applications " . Biomedical ontologies and terminologies received high attention in the last decade and provide promising technologies.The Organic Data Science Framework software is open source and is released on GitHub under an Apache 2.0 license. 3 Other external systems that we plan to integrate into the Organic Data Science framework include data repositories  , software repositories  , collaboration networks  , and publication repositories.The results of the performance for the TSA algorithm with cross correlation distance function over WS-353 are presented in Table 8. The correlation of such words  , such as " Mars " and " water " in 1900 should be weighted differently from the correlation they exhibit in 2008  , when NASA images suggested the presence of water on Mars.The server side is implemented with Java Servlets and uses Jena. We use Sindice Search API to search the WoD and Lucene for indexing/fuzzy retrieval model.Due to the community effort behind GERBIL  , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9. Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework  , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.Using TF-IDF 18 to cluster documents and pairwise cosine similarity to measure the similarity of all articles in each cluster  , they found that tags categorize articles in the broad sense. The authors used 350 popular tags from Technorati and 250 of the most recent articles of the collected tags.by better interlinking the data with other Linked Data datasets and providing a proper ontology for querying. We also aim at improving the OpenStreetMap data usage scenario  , e.g.The open source Sindice any23 4 parser is used to extract RDF data from many different formats. Sources are then fetched in parallel in a process mediated by multiple cache levels  , e.g.  , making ample use of the Sindice public cache.Another recent example is schema.org  , an ontology to mark up data on the web with schema information. For example  , in biology there is the Gene Ontology and in medicine 7  there is the International Classification of Diseases ICD ontology.If the resource descriptions includes OWL inverse functional properties IFPs from a hardcoded list e.g.  , foaf:mbox and foaf:homepage  , then a Sindice index search for other resources having the same IFP value is performed. If the resource descriptions include any owl:sameAs links  , then the target URIs are considered.For SourceForge we used its own internal ranking metric to select the top ranked repositories. For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories  , i.e.  , repositories that have been marked as favorites by developers and/or have been forked the most.However  , participants were free to use any of the other Blog06 collection components for retrieval such as the XML feeds and/or the HTML homepages. As mentioned in Section 2  , for the purposes of the opinion finding task  , the document retrieval unit in the collection is a single blog post plus all of its associated comments as identified by a permalink .This fan-in  " citations-from "  and fan-out  " citations-to "  then provides the user with links to all articles in the database that have cited a given article  , as well as to all articles that have been co-cited alongside hence are related to the given article. First  , wherever possible  , Citebase links each reference cited by a given article to the full-text of the article that it cites if it is in the database.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98. But this scheme is computationally intensive: Onm  , where m is the number of users in the database.The BLOG06 corpus contains feeds ranking in size from just 1 or 2 posts to feeds with several hun- dred. To support a simplified federated search model of feed retrieval  , we chose to create a new collection by sampling the posts from each feed.Using these input queries  , our system search the WoD by utilizing Sindice search API 2 and initial search results from the Sindice search are presented to users with no categorization. Users can provide keyword or URI based queries to the system.In WPBench  , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications. Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.The chances that those contributions will get accepted are higher with pull requests; across Github  , more than 70% of external contributions are merged 40% in other studies 29  , 32 . With pull requests  , developers can contribute to any repository  , without loss of authorship information .For each EconStor author  , we harvest several other repositories for correlations with other authors  , publications or other relevant information about the initial author. EconStor content has also been published in the LOD.Figure 6plots exposure generation time against lines of source code for each of these applications . We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.A significant portion of both integrators and contributors find that the communication facilities afforded by the GitHub PR mechanism are lacking in terms of immediacy and structure. Communication tooling.Those articles should be classified to four categories: Tumor biology  , Embryologic gene expression  , Alleles of mutant phenotypes and Gene Ontology. 60305006 articles collected from MGI correctly for the curators for exhaustive analyses.Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology. For neurons  , the four main compartments are cell body  , dendrite  , axon and spine.The dynamic of the OpenStreetMap project will ensure a steady growth of the dataset. This enhancement enables a variety of new Linked Data applications such as geo data syndication or semantic-spatial searches.Our work focused on the document triage subtask. The categorization task was composed of a document triage subtask and an annotation subtask to detect the presence of evidence in the document for each of the three main Gene Ontology GO code hierarchies.We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads. The test queries include output tests  , selections  , joins  , projections  , aggregates  , and updates.Its responsiveness performance is closer to users' perception than any of other benchmarks. Since the Web content  , user interactions  , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers  , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers.Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO  , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function  , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products. One of the key features of knowledge engineering in bioinformatics is the need for community involvement in the development of schemas and ontologies.The instances of these classes may come from the literature or locally curated data repositories. Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology.Considering the large amount of resources per dataset  , we investigate samplebased strategies as follows: SPARQL endpoint from DataHub in step i  , step ii extracts resource types and instances via SPARQL queries 5 that conform to the definition of resource types and instances in Section 2.The publication of the OpenStreetMap data using Triplify adds a completely new dimension to the Data Web: spatial data can be retrieved and interlinked on an unprecedented level of granularity. Performance results for retrieving points-of-interest in different areas are summarized in Table 3.Even assuming that these slow algorithms scale linearly with the problem size  , which is not true for most of them  , the analysis of large graphs may require unaffordable times. Oslom takes several days to analyze the Orkut graph whereas SCD finds the communities in a few minutes.However  , creating and maintaining the knowledge bases requires enormous work. In the past  , researchers in biomedicine have already constructed large scale of databases such as UMLS 1  , Gene Ontology 2  , SwissProt 3  , GenBank 4  , DIP 5  , SNOMED 6  , and LocusLink 7 etc.  , which are useful for researches to capture and organize information.There are various reasons why developers are more prolific on GitHub compared to other platforms. In fact  , contributing to as many GitHub projects as possible is an accomplishment  , valued by peers and employers alike 32.These conclusions can be helpful to improve the performance of Semantic Search engine implementations based on Lucene  , such as Sindice  , Watson  , Falcons or SEMPLORE. Confirmed evidence of the reasons behind the bimodal distribution would make possible to propose better retrieval approaches that are able to enhance the performance of the queries for which the current approaches fail to provide satisfactory results.17 That is  , the AIDA team discourages the use because they constantly switch the underlying entity repository  , and tune parameters. The authors publish a key-protected webservice 14 as well as their 43  , GERBIL will not use the webservice since it is not stable enough for regular replication purposes at the moment of this publication .We filter out those points which are either outside of the city boundary or in the ocean. In fact  , by taking the OpenStreetMap polygons for Santa Barbara and Ventura and defining a regular point grid of 1 × 1 km  , we can compute the probability of grid points contained in Ventura to locate in the southeast of Santa Barbara grid points.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub. Selection Criteria.A disadvantage of the image system is that it can not highlight search terms within an article. Part of it reflects the ease with which computers can drown inexperienced users in material: for example  , of undergraduate searches on the University of California online catalog  , MELVYL  , those that retrieve any titles at all retrieve an average of 400.To achieve this goal  , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks. To ensure the practicability and convenience of the GER- BIL framework  , we investigated the effort needed to use GERBIL for the evaluation of novel annotators.We note that the complete example  , including the exemplary queries in an executable form  , is available at http://purl.org/NET/scovo 4—shows the list of high-performing airports along with the time period  , starting with the best airport in terms of " on-timeness " .The data contains only English content with 8.1M blog posts from 2.7M unique blogs. Technorati provided us a slice of their data from a sixteen day period in late 2006.In future  , we plan to investigate the effect of adding other references to the query such as pronouns and use the opinion evidence in those positions. Experimental results over Blog06 collection showed the advantage of using multiple opinion query positions in comparing the opinion score of documents.The tool that transforms OAIster metadata from Simple Dublin Core to our native DLXS Bibliographic Class was modified so that it could ingest the file from the first step  , and output a transformed metadata record. 2.For example  , the biomedical community has taken the lead in such activities; every model organism database has genes and proteins that are widely annotated using the Gene Ontology GO. These annotations describe properties of these concepts.In GERBIL  , we make use of the D2KB task  , which evaluates entity disambiguation only. To evaluate DoSeR as well as the competitive disambiguation systems we use the GERBIL -General Entity Annotator Benchmark 23  which offers an easy-touse platform for the agile comparison of annotators using multiple data sets.In the Shop.com dataset  , however  , we have both the product price information and the quantity that a consumer purchased in each record. We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation  , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction   , which is absent in many of the public datasets.Segments in curly brackets denote whole URLs that match predefined URL patterns   , such as GitHub URLs as denoted by {github}. The classes and segments are shown in Table 1.Our definition may overly combine repositories  , but we believe it makes context switches more likely to be between distinct entities. Given the ease with which different projects can depend on each other on GitHub  , determining the exact boundaries of a project is difficult.2012 an in-depth qualitative user study is conducted on a small group of GitHub users  , aimed at understanding the motivations that are the basis of online collaboration and the consequences of using a transparent large-scale tool on the practice of software development . In Dabbish et al.On the other hand  , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication . In S2  , we observed that storing and authenticating user login is the most common task needed by participants S2- Obs.1.BLOG06 is a collection of blog home pages  , blog entry pages permalinks and XML feed documents. As stated above  , this task is ranking blog feeds in response to a query  , not blog posts.GitHub is a project-hosting site started in 2008 that brands itself as "Social Coding." In addition  , participants have a profile page that lists personal information as well as activityrelated information such as the repositories they own and watch as well as the participants that they follow.While MIAME and MIAPE provide useful guidelines for organizing gene expression and proteomic data into a database  , such adequate standards do not yet exist for the description of clinicopathology data acquired from patients afflicted with most polygenic diseases. Again as with MIAME  , this minimum information will be described using an ontology that not only contains vocabulary terms for describing proteomics related concepts but also defines the interrelationship between these terms.In fact  , by taking the OpenStreetMap polygons for Santa Barbara and Ventura and defining a regular point grid of 1 × 1 km  , we can compute the probability of grid points contained in Ventura to locate in the southeast of Santa Barbara grid points. This may be true for a certain point-feature representation of the cities but is not correct for all points inside the city boundaries.The AIDA annotator as well as the " Illinois Wikifier " will not be available in GERBIL since we restrict ourselves to webservices. 's initial work 7 in 2014  , GERBIL's community effort led to the implementation of overall 6 new annotators as well as the before mentioned generic NIF-based annotator.This was an encouraging result; it suggests that human credibility judgments are correlated with features in addition to inlink counts. When compared with the rankings determined by Technorati inlink counts  , the average pairwise Kenall tau correlation with human rankings was only 0.30.More recently  , there has been great interest in the application of ontological technologies  , particularly since the advent of the Gene Ontology 2  , which has been widely adopted. In this paper  , we describe these requirements in more detail and the design and implementation of the Pedro tool  , which seeks to fulfill them.We believe that it would be possible for a search engine company to perform this analysis  , either automatically e.g.  , using statistical natural language processing and/or by relying on white-lists provided by vigilante groups  , such as Technorati. Therefore  , in order to assure a proper representation of the domain in the core  , one would need to analyze a fair fraction of the individual blogs and assemble a list of good ones.However  , at very different levels: the probability of knowing the type set for a given property set ranges between 15.15% and 54.85%. Again  , and with the exception of Datahub D  , the other data sets exhibit a similar trend.Examining this list immediately points out several challenges to users of tags and designers of tagging systems. Figure 1 contains a list of the top 250 tags used by blog writers to annotate their own entries  , collected from Technorati on October 6  , 2005.This allows for a quick comparison of tools and datasets on recently run experiments without additional computational effort. It is accessible at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil/ experiment ?id=201503050003 visualizations  , 30 see Figure 2 .Second  , having identified the important multitasking and focus switching effectors on programmer productivity  , we proceed to investigate how these dimensions interact  , and which tradeoffs between them exist. First  , we seek a deeper understanding of multitasking and its effects for software developers active on GitHub.The project should include a clear articulation of what is expected from a pull request  , for example tests or localized changes  , on a prominent location in the project's Github page. To avoid development concurrency related issues  , core team members could ask contributors to communicate their indented changes by opening an issue that is then augmented by code and converted to a pull request.In addition to the work on semantic search engines  , there have been multiple attempts to extend existing SPARQL endpoints with more advanced NLP tooling such as fuzzy string matching and ranking over results 9 ,12 ,15. With Sindice being discontinued in 2014  , no text-based Semantic Web search engine is widely available to the Semantic Web community today.This set of user information includes 95 ,270 unique GitHub user accounts. For this dataset  , we also gathered information about each unique GitHub user associated with the set of pull requests.However  , the sixth kind of interaction  , in which a program written in one language executes another program written in a different language Execution 38  , raises more issues about comprehending  , analyzing  , and evolving programs. The survey of GitHub repositories identified these five kinds of interactions to be the most com- mon 37.The low graph density and average degree indicate that on GitHub the follow action is associated with a high cost  , as following many developers results in receiving many notifications from them. The followers graph G F we obtain has a total of 671 ,751 nodes and 2 ,027 ,564 edges  , with a resulting graph density of 4.4932e-06 and an average degree of 3.019.TSA results shown in the table are computed using cross correlation with a quadratic weighted function as the distance metric between single time series. The comparison results of TSA on the WS-353 dataset are reported in Table 1.GERBIL can be used with systems and datasets from any domain. compared more than 15 systems on 20 different datasets.Nowadays  , the Lehigh University Benchmark LUBM is the de facto standard when it comes to reasoning with large ontologies 3 ,19 ,8 ,20 ,21. Gene Ontology 1 or Airport Codes Ontology 2  which are used for benchmarking can be found in 18.Figure 1shows a partial hierarchy tree extracted from the Gene Ontology. Besides  , an edge exists between a class and an instance in the hierarchy tree if and only if there is a type relation between them in the data.Hence  , while keeping the implementation effort previously required to evaluate on a single dataset  , we allow developers to evaluate on currently  11 times more datasets. The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work.For the experimental resulbs given here  , the set Q cont.ains 817 ,093 title keyterms t#hat were extracted from a sample of 885 ,930 MELVYL catalog FIND commands of which 326 ,511 referenced bhe title keyterm index recorded from public access MELVYL catalog termino.ls during part of 1986. The method used to estimate se- lectivity based on uniform distributions has an obvious extension when applied to IN predicates as discussed in Section 3.Our study was guided by two research questions. We frame our study in the context of multitasking across GitHub projects  , i.e.  , switching back and forth between multiple projects that one contributes to  , within a short period of time our operationalization below is one week.In the hundred relation most of the attributes have exactly 100 unique AS3AP benchmark: the storage organization of the relation and the selectivity factor of the query. In the uniques relation all attributes have unique values.The fact that CORE caches the actual full-text content in order to process the documents and to discover additional metadata distinguishes this approach from a number of other Open Access federated search systems  , such as BASE or OAISTER  , that rely only on the metadata accessible through OAI-PMH. The CORE system provides this functionality and is optimized for regular metadata harvesting and full-text downloading of large amounts of content.The study of long term programming practice evolution can be expanded on a number of fronts. Social coding  , as performed on GitHub  , and cloud computing come to mind  , but other new ways to drive progress surely remain to be discovered.Additionally  , from the application of SCOVO in voiD we have learned that there is a demand for aggregates. It is for sure possible to concatenate single dimensions used on the scovo:Item-level—for example concluding from the range of the four quarters ex:Q12006 to ex:Q42006 that the dataset actually is referring to the year 2006.However  , these datasets do not include multilingual CH metadata. GERBIL can be used with systems and datasets from any domain.As a concession to ease of analysis  , only projects using the popular Maven 4 build system were considered. Projects were taken from Github 15  , one of the largest public repositories of Java projects.It is accessible at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil/ experiment ?id=201503050003 visualizations  , 30 see Figure 2 . Next to individual configurable experiments  , GERBIL offers an overview of recent experiment results belonging to the same experiment and matching type in the form of a Table 5: Results of an example experiment.It is organized into three disjoint hierarchies: molecular functions MF  , biological processes BP and cellular components CC. The Gene Ontology 11  is a controlled vocabulary of terms GO codes describing gene product attributes.The first challenge is to identify a set of initial sources that describe the entity sought for by the user. The open source Sindice any23 4 parser is used to extract RDF data from many different formats.Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites  , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website  , shop.com  , for our experiments. The method is denoted as SV Dmatrix.Systems that provide this sort of optimal access via Z39.50 include the MELVYL catalog and the COPAC catalog hosted by Manchester Computing in the U.K. If as with some servers language can only be used in conjunction with another search element to restrict the resultset to records in that language  , then the extraction program may need to use multiple searches to select a topical or other subset of the records in the target language.Shown below is a plot of correlations between ratings for all pairs of jokes computed over the ratings posted by these users. The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.To conduct our scalability experiments  , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1. Our parallel LDA code was implemented in C++.Our survey comprised five developers with expert-level programming skills in Java. To achieve this goal  , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.Technorati provided us a slice of their data from a sixteen day period in late 2006. To evaluate TagAssist  , we used data provided to use by Technorati  , a leading authority in blog search and aggregation.Using various data sources of substantial size gives the opportunity to find intended POIs  , which may fall into multiple concepts ranging from rather generic to more detailed ones such as " restaurant " vs. " pizzeria. " First  , for a meaningful search result  , we need to consider data obtained by integrating multiple data sources  , which may be provided by autonomous vendors in heterogeneous formats e.g.  , OpenStreetMap or Open Government Data data  , a restaurant guide  , etc.These interactions are emulated during benchmarking browsers by instrumented JavaScript which is independent of Web browsers. In WPBench  , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.One reason for the ubiquity of Orkut is most likely due to the power of influencers and the practice of account gifting. Contrasting the social stigma in America where only young people are perceived to use popular social networks  , Orkut is part of society in Brazil  , as it is not only used by teenagers  , but parents  , relatives  , and even taxi drivers as well.This searching was by no means complete and no relevance judgements from this phase were retained. The assessor then searched the Blog06 test collection to see if blog posts with relevant opinions appear in the collection.We began by collecting the 350 most popular tags from Technorati . This was intended to tell us whether humans did a better job of categorizing articles than automated techniques.As is noted by the Melvyl Recommender project  , OCA texts often silently drop hyphens. The OCA texts need a small amount of additional preprocessing .In shop.com dataset  , the short-head 20% involves 0.814% of popular products. The 80:20 rule 7  is commonly used to divide between long-tail products and popular ones.The Blog06 test collection includes a crawl of feeds XML  , associated permalinks HTML  , retrieval units  , and homepages during Dec 2005 through early 2006. 50 test topics  , each consisting of title phrase  , description sentence  , and narrative paragraph fields  , were constructed using queries from commercial blog search engines e.g.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.The Celestial mirror is used within Southampton by Citebase Search. While Celestial is a distinct  , freely-downloadable software package  , at Southampton University 3 a mirror of Celestial hosts a copy of the metadata from 161 different OAI archives OAI-registered archives including the OAI-registered eprints.org archives  , plus any unregistered eprints.org installations found  , and active archives registered with the Repository Explorer 9.In addition  , we invited developers in the most active threequartiles by total count of days active for the user survey. Note that our definition of project as a collection of repositories owned by the same GitHub user is broader than the definition of project as a main repository together with all its forks  , proposed in the literature 25.The Open Biomedical Ontologies project 14 and the Gene Ontology Consortium 16 are an example of two related efforts for developing a coherent set of ontologies for this domain. Most ontologies are built monolithically  , but some groups are aiming at building sets of inter-related ontologies.SCOVO is used in voiD  , the " Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets " 1  to express information about the number of triples  , resources and so forth. 5kudos to Andreas Langegger for the screen shot  , that generates statistics for datasets behind SPARQL-endpoints and RDF documents.RDFa data itself contains information using a number of common and less common ontologies  , making it hard to exploit efficiently . We may note that not all forms of data are equally useful for presenting to the user  , including the most popular tagging microformat originally invented for giving hints to the Technorati search engine for categorizing blog posts.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories  , i.e.  , repositories that have been marked as favorites by developers and/or have been forked the most. These repositories span several programming languages: Java  , C  , C++  , JavaScript  , and Python.Oslom takes several days to analyze the Orkut graph whereas SCD finds the communities in a few minutes. For practical purposes  , this computational complexity creates a barrier to analyze large networks by the group of slow algorithms.46 found that stakeholders external to the project may influence the evaluation discussions while power plays are in effect. By focusing on how discussions affect contribution evaluation in GitHub  , Tsay et al.The metadata OAIster collects is in Simple Dublin Core format. Since we combine the text from the three elements  , this type of misuse does not affect our subject metadata enrichment.To ensure that our sample consisted of repositories that make effective and large-scale use of PRs  , we selected all repositories in the GHTorrent dataset 24 that have received at least one PR per week during the year 2013 3 ,400 repositories. Previous work has revealed that most GitHub repositories are inactive and have a single user 25  , 31 .The results provide evidence for the need to weigh the recent changes in time series distance measurement higher than the ancient changes. The results of the performance for the TSA algorithm with cross correlation distance function over WS-353 are presented in Table 8.We have evaluated the proposed method on the BLOG06 collection. Our results show that normalization can be important  , and that the best normalization strategy is dependent on the underling relevance retrieval baseline.The Web Data Commons project extracts all Microformat  , Microdata and RDFa data from the Common Crawl Web corpus  , the largest and most up-to-data Web corpus that is currently available to the public  , and provides the extracted data for download in the form of RDF-quads and also in the form of CSV-tables for common entity types e.g.  , products  , organizations  , locations  , etc. The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was crawled based on datasets provided by Falcon-S  , Sindice  , Swoogle  , SWSE  , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.Additionally  , we employed Triplify to publish the 160GB of geo data collected by the OpenStreetMap project. We tested and evaluated Triplify by integrating it into a number of popular Web applications.However  , it was more convenient for us to download the most up-todate original OpenStreetMap data about Bremen  , available as Shapefiles 10 . OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .The selected features are split into three categories: Pull request characteristics. The feature selection was based on prior work in the areas of patch submission and acceptance 24  , 4  , 32  , 3  , code reviewing 28  , bug triaging 1  , 14  and also on semistructured interviews of Github developers 9  , 26  , 22.This may explain the relatively small absolute improvement of tLSA over LSA. However  , the words in the WS-353 dataset are relatively common  , and primarily related to static concepts  , such as " car " and " love " .19 found that when GitHub developers engage in information-seeking behaviors  , they use signals in the environment to form impressions of users and projects. Marlow et al.Awareness can be increased by contacting the development team using real-time communication channels e.g.  , IRC or its evolved counterpart GITTER  , which is better integrated in GitHub or by following the minimal PR idiom 7  depending on project preferences. Maximizing awareness.Firstly  , Technorati's data is over posts  , not authors  , and  , secondly  , Technorati's index contains a noticable amount of non-post data including weblog home pages and some non-weblog content. Comparing the Technorati language breakdown with our author data is not straightforward.While AGDISTIS has been in the source code of the BAT-Framework provided by a third-party after publication of Cornolti et al. Table 1compares the implemented annotation systems of GERBIL and the BAT-Framework.The Web Data Commons project extracts all Microformat  , Microdata and RDFa data from the Common Crawl Web corpus and provides the extracted data for download in the form of RDF-quads or CSV-tables for common entity types e.g.  , products  , organizations   , locations  , etc. The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S  , Sindice  , Swoogle  , SWSE  , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.Friendster 1 and Orkut 2 are among the earliest and most successful SNSs. As a kind of online application  , SNSs are useful to register personal information including a user's friends and acquaintances on these systems; the systems promote information exchange such as sending messages and reading Weblogs.Some of our respondents also indicated that contributions to GitHub benefit their career growth e.g.  , " My contribution to projects allowed me to obtain a job within my favorite subjects " r437. This incentive increases in strength as the audience's visibility into the performance increases 33.While developing GERBIL  , we spotted several flaws in the formal model underlying previous benchmarking frameworks which we aim to tackle in the future. More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website.These two formats contain different XML elements which were mapped to a unified representation in order to make use of the structural elements within the feeds. The BLOG06 collection contains approximately 100k feed documents  , which are a mix of ATOM and RSS XML.Although distinct in the nature of the information objects they handle  , such systems have common functional and architectural patterns regarding the collection  , storage  , manipulation  , and provision of information objects. Renown examples of such systems can be found in the institutional repository area  , where research communities are interested in processing publications e.g.  , OCLC-OAIster  , 1 BASE  , 2 DAREnet-NARCIS 3   , and lately experimental data  , collected from OAI-PMH data sources; or in projects such as SAPIR 4   , where an advanced system was built to automatically extract indexing features from images and videos collected from web sources.To allow semantic search engines to efficiently and effectively process the dataset it is advisable to use proper announcement mechanisms such as the semantic crawler sitemap extension protocol 8. For example offering an RDF dump in N-Triples for semantic search engines such as Sindice 26 along a SPARQL-endpoint for cross-site query is a typical pattern.We also considered the barriers that make it difficult for new contributors to participate. Subsequently  , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.All the rest are long-tail prod- ucts. In shop.com dataset  , the short-head 20% involves 0.814% of popular products.Being a web-based platform it can be also used to publish the disambiguation results. 29  proposed GERBIL - General Entity Annotator Benchmark  , an easy-to-use platform for the agile comparison of annotators using multiple data sets and uniform measuring approaches.Attracting participants. We sent them an email if their address was registered with GitHub and if they were not integrators in the same repository; we collected 4 ,617 emails.Thus  , we decided to index a particular dataset for stable and comparative evaluations. However  , Sindice search results may change due to dynamic indexing.We imported the Shapefiles into a PostGIS database and created virtual geospatial RDF views on top of them using Ontop-spatial  , as described at https://github. However  , it was more convenient for us to download the most up-todate original OpenStreetMap data about Bremen  , available as Shapefiles 10 .Authority would seem to be closely related to the notion of credibility. The Technorati 1 blog search engine calculates a measure of blog authority as the log of the number of incoming blog links over a six month period 9.They find that people use GitHub for several reasons: to learn how to code better  , to follow popular developers   , to find new interesting projects  , and to promote themselves and their work. 2012 an in-depth qualitative user study is conducted on a small group of GitHub users  , aimed at understanding the motivations that are the basis of online collaboration and the consequences of using a transparent large-scale tool on the practice of software development .Another problem is  , although less frequent  , that the extracted URLs are sometimes not permalinks but hyperlinks to the web pages the blog posts are commenting on. The same problem was found for BLOG06-feed-000036  , BLOG06-feed-000043  , and many others.The threshold values of different thresholding strategies were derived or estimated by cross validation on training data and are shown in Table 2. The C values in Equation 5 for the four tasks were set by across validation: 0.0055 Allele  , 0.0032 Expression  , 0.0125 Gene Ontology and 0.006 Tumor.All these systems have the aim of collecting and indexing ontologies from the web and providing  , based on keywords or other inputs  , efficient mechanisms to retrieve ontologies and semantic data. Most of the research work related to the ontology search task concerns the development of SWSE systems 7  , including: Watson 8  , Sindice 28  , Swoogle 11  , OntoSelect 4  , ontokhoj 5 and OntoSearch 32.One very important issue is what we call " statisticalpresentation fidelity " . Further  , our ongoing work focuses on broadening the deployment base available 17   , making converters from and to SCOVO available  , and extending the framework itself.Table 9provides details on the number of presumed splog posts which infiltrated each element of the relevance scale. Finally  , we report on the extent to which the 17 ,958 presumed splog feeds and their associated 509 ,137 spam posts  , which were injected into the Blog06 collection during its creation have infiltrated the pool.We used three different sources to deal with the above kinds of synonyms: The AcroMed database of biomedical acronyms For every input topic  , our system searches the topic text for occurrences of acronyms stored in the AcroMed database. Following the Gene Ontology terminology  , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms   , such as acronyms.We see in prior work about GitHub that there are certain contribution norms that signal a technically well-prepared contribution. H1: Contributions that show signs of following technical contribution norms are more likely to be accepted.Each row in the table corresponds to one bug report and one debugging scenario. Each bug reporter has spent time manually creating these Table 1identify the selected subject programs and their associated bug reports all taken from GitHub.The participants where selected from the community of Semantic Web SW developers on Github who have had at least one active SW-related repository. In order to understand the current pitfalls of LDA UI design  , we conducted a survey targeting active Semantic Web developers 2 .Among the blog document set 100 ,649 feeds 38GB  , 2.8 million permalinks 75GB  , and 325 ,000 homepages 20GB  , only the permalinks were used in our experiment. The Blog06 test collection includes a crawl of feeds XML  , associated permalinks HTML  , retrieval units  , and homepages during Dec 2005 through early 2006.We developed a Ruby script to automatically clone each repository in the resulting list  , check that it contains a Rails application  , install its dependencies  , and run the application. We used the Github Archive database 4 to make a list of the most-watched Rails-associated repositories.We divide our experiments into two parts. The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation.We have found evidence for such positive effects of knowledge transfers on productivity past experience with a programming language during prior work on GitHub 10. Similarly  , exposure to more projects brings about exposure to different environments   , providing opportunities to develop transferrable skills.In 2012  , we consolidated the set Bio2RDF open source 5 scripts into a single GitHub repository bio2rdf-scripts 6 . Thirty PHP scripts  , one Java program and a Ruby gem are now available for any use including commercial   , modification and redistribution by anyone wishing to generate BioRDF data  , or to improve the quality of RDF conversions currently used in Bio2RDF.50 test topics  , each consisting of title phrase  , description sentence  , and narrative paragraph fields  , were constructed using queries from commercial blog search engines e.g.  , BlogPulse and Technorati. Among the blog document set 100 ,649 feeds 38GB  , 2.8 million permalinks 75GB  , and 325 ,000 homepages 20GB  , only the permalinks were used in our experiment.This allows the user to search for articles by author  , keywords in the title or abstract  , publication e.g. The front-end of Citebase is a meta-search engine.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs. Opinion modules require opinion lexicons  , which are extracted from training data.In order to publish the OpenStreetMap data  , we performed some preprocessing of the data structures. Overall  , the project had produced a 160GB database of geo data until July 2008  , in some regions surpassing commercial geo data providers in terms of precision and detail.Linked- GeoData is derived from OpenStreetMap and OpenStreetMap is an open  , collaborative bottom-up effort for collecting this large-scale spatial knowledge base. The assumptions we make on the considered dataset are as follows.Empty query results are indicators for missing in-links. We estimate the number of in-links by iterating over all elements in AC and querying the Sindice 9 SPARQL endpoint for triples containing the concept's URI in the object part.Semantic search engines  , such as Sindice 14 and Swoogle 5  , or index sites for the Semantic Web 4 are good starting points to search for existing vocabularies. There already exist a number of widely used vocabularies  , many of which are applicable for desktop data.One option is to extract all lexical information from the URI  , labels  , properties and property values of the LOD resources that are retrieved by Sindice search. To achieve this  , the concepts of LOD resources should be understood  , where lexical information about LOD resources can be used to mine such knowledge.Even in cases where there is a document  , an evaluation based on document rankings is not able to measure some of the key advantages of semantic search such as being able to give precise answers to factual questions or that answers can be computed by aggregating knowledge from different documents. This is the case for example with search engines that crawl and index Linked Data such as Sindice 19.The Datahub data set shows a far more balanced behaviour. However  , at very different levels: the probability of knowing the type set for a given property set ranges between 15.15% and 54.85%.More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website. In comparison to earlier frameworks  , it extends the stateof-the-art benchmarks by the capability of considering the influence of NIL attributes and the ability of dealing with data sets and annotators that link to different knowledge bases.Our system automatically consults external knowledge sources  , and links concepts extracted from the documents to terminology in these sources. The primary input to our taxonomy generator is a collection of documents and  , optionally  , a taxonomy for a related domain e.g.  , the Agrovoc thesaurus or the Gene ontology.However  , bias in the contributors' answers could not be completely eradicated  , as can be witnessed by the fact that many open-ended answers included direct references to GitHub or tools in its ecosystem e.g.  , Travis CI. In both our question set and our interpretation of the results  , we avoided direct references to GitHub's implementation of the mechanism.GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology. The persistent URIs enhance the long term quotation in the field of information extraction.This yields to complex SPARQL expressions  , as it will often require a verbose check to make sure that an item has only certain dimensions and no others. Using SCOVO in voiD allows a simple and extendable description of statistical information  , however  , a shortcoming has been identified: as scovo:Items are grouped into scovo:Datasets  , there is an implicit assumption that all items in such a dataset share the same dimensions.To begin  , we randomly selected 250 of the top 1000 tags from Technorati. To test this hypothesis  , we decided to use agglomerative cluster- ing 5 to construct a hierarchy of tags.We preprocessed the OAIster collection to produce the bag-of-words representation as follows: Starting with the 668 repositories in the 9/2/2006 harvest  , we excluded 163 primarily non-English repositories  , and 117 small repositories containing fewer than 500 records  , leaving 388 repositories. The input to the topic model is the so-called " bag-of-words representation " of a collection  , in which every metadata record is represented by a sparse vector of word counts  , i.e.  , a list of {word-id  , record-id  , count} triples.RQ1 To assess the popularity of the pull-based development model  , we provide and analyze descriptive statistics on the use of pull requests in Github. Below  , we present how we approached each research question.Maximizing awareness. In the case of GitHub  , external services are available to enable continuous integration e.g.  , Travis and code quality e.g.  , Code Climate monitoring on a per contribution basis.In the COPAC catalog  , for example  , a Z39.50 search for language=arabic returns 44549 records with Arabic titles. Systems that provide this sort of optimal access via Z39.50 include the MELVYL catalog and the COPAC catalog hosted by Manchester Computing in the U.K.The collection included a selection of " top blogs " provided by Nielsen BuzzMetrics and supplemented by the University of Amsterdam. A new collection  , called Blog06  , was created by the University of Glasgow.With GERBIL  , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks. In this paper  , we presented and evaluated GERBIL  , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks.Through Github facilities. The versatility of Git enables pull requests to be merged in three ways  , presented below sorted by the amount of preservation of the original source code properties: 1.Citebase provides information about both the citation impact and usage impact of research articles and authors  , generated from the open-access pre-print and postprint literature that Citebase covers. This allows the user to navigate back in time articles referred-to  , forward in time cited-by  , and sideways co-cited alongside.For real-life data  , we use a set of DAG-structured gene ontology data from the Gene Ontology Consortium and XML data generated from the XMark benchmark 22 with random additions of acyclic IDREFs. For example  , the typical configurations for our synthetic data sets use fanout and fan-in ranging from 2 to 20  , diameter up to 20  , and 10 to 50 distinct labels which are evenly distributed .This list of ten further illustrates the variety of content found in metadata repositories. The ten largest repositories by size in MB from our 9/2/2006 OAIster harvest are listed in Table 1.For Jester  , which had a high density of available ratings  , the model was a 300-fold compression. In other words  , the model was a 10-fold compression of the original data.2 For use with the graphs described above  , the weights in the initialization vector u are the click frequencies of the corresponding documents in the session under examination  , that is  , We used a custom implementation of the algorithm  , available on GitHub.worked on snippet generation for a semantic search engine Sindice that indexes instance data 2. In a Web search setting  , Bai et al.For all the conducted experiments  , we have validated the soundness and completeness of our algorithms by comparing the output solutions with those produced by the alternative algorithms. For real-life data  , we use a set of DAG-structured gene ontology data from the Gene Ontology Consortium and XML data generated from the XMark benchmark 22 with random additions of acyclic IDREFs.Since " Illinois Wikifier " is currently only available as local binary and GERBIL is solely based on webservices we excluded it from GER- BIL for the sake of comparability and server load. The authors provide their datasets 9 as well as their software " Illinois Wikifier " 10 online.Now let's consider another example – a patent or publication  citation network. For example  , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.First  , the consolidation of scripts into a single GitHub repository will make it easier for the community to report problems  , contribute code fixes  , or contribute new scripts to add more data into the Bio2RDF network of linked data for the life sciences. Bio2RDF Release 2 marks several important milestones for the open source Bio2RDF project.Exactly how existing systems extract keywords from RDF data is largely undocumented. Falcons  , Semplore  , SWSE and Sindice search for schema and data alike.frequent descriptors are gene expression  , phylogenetic tree  , microarray experiment  , hierarchical clustering  , amino acid sequences  , motif  , etc. Descriptors are used to profile a given resource and/or to link it to a domain ontology e.g.We used a custom implementation of the algorithm  , available on GitHub. For all of our experiments  , we used a restart factor of c = 0.2  , a convergence distance of = 0.005  , and a max iteration cap of ρ = 1000.We examine blog entries indexed by Technorati and compare the similarity of articles that share tags to determine whether articles that have the same tags actually contain similar content. In this paper  , we discuss some initial experiments that aim to determine what tasks are suitable for tags  , how blog authors are using tags  , and whether tags are effective as an information retrieval mechanism.The citation impact of an article is the number of citations to that article. Citebase provides information about both the citation impact and usage impact of research articles and authors  , generated from the open-access pre-print and postprint literature that Citebase covers.Nevertheless  , we have adapted the AS3AP benchmark to fit into our purposes. AS3AP is the ANSI SQL Standard Scaleable and Portable Benchmark for comparing relational DBMSs.For each supported type  , swim extracts structured call sequences from the source files in the code corpus. This is because for most classes T in the API framework  , GitHub contains many more usage samples than can be extracted from web pages.When viewing a cached full-text PDF  , Citebase overlays reference links within the document  , so a user can jump from viewing a full-text to the abstract page of a cited article. This provides a visual link between the citation and web impacts.Since we decided to focus on Milano and London  , however  , we can discard this potential issue: our direct knowledge of the city of Milano let us affirm that the spatial objects mapping is quite good and homogeneous throughout the city; OpenStreetMap coverage in the London area was evaluated in 18 and shown to be quite accurate in comparison to official sources. Still  , the mapping can be inhomogeneous some zones can be more detailed annotated than others.In the context of sub-question 3  , we will perform various crowdsourcing tasks e.g. The " Open Knowledge Extraction " challenge at ESWC 7 and frameworks such as GERBIL 28 are good systems to validate our approach.A distributed development workflow is effective if pull requests are eventually accepted  , and it is efficient if the time this takes is as short as possible. Moreover  , the review mechanism that Github incorporates has the additional effect of improving awareness 9 ; core developers can access in an efficient way all information that relates to a pull request and solicit opinions of the community  " crowd-source "  about the merging de- cision.Even if it is not possible to provide definitive evidence about that  , in the following we will show some interesting correlations between the activity of a user and some indirect rewards in terms of " social prestige " in GitHub. We hypothesize that for a hybrid service like GitHub  , both a social network and a collaboration network  , some kind of indirect reward mechanism might and potentially underpin user activity.We also confirmed our overall result by studying entire evolutionary history of all the projects  , analyzed with 6 months snapshot interval. To minimize this threat  , we use systems from different domain from Github and Apache  , having a substantial variation in age  , size and ratio of bugs to overall lines see table 1.As a " silver standard " for evaluating suite quality  , mutation testing is used  , as identifying real faults of hundreds of Java projects was clearly infeasible. While the results are based only on open source Java programs hosted on Github  , and using the popular Maven build system  , it is likely that our findings apply at minimum to many other Java projects  , and may well apply to other languages as well.For example  , assume that the ontology included a Mutation class  , where a Gene has a Mutation that causes a Disease  , then the corresponding fragment of the rule consequent would be: hasMutation. However  , we generate unique regular URIs to support linking owl:sameAs into these URIs at a later stage.From the pull requests that have been opened in 2013  , 73 ,07% have been merged using Github facilities  , thereby indicating that pull requests in principle can work as a means for obtaining external contributions. Projects exists   , such as Ruby on Rails and the Homebrew package manager  , that have more that 5 ,000 pull requests.Github automatically detects conflicting pull requests and marks them as such. Merging such a pull request will result in conflicts.The lists had only objective  , positive  , neutral or negative sentences from the given document. We Figure 2: The Overview of the system ran our opinion detection and polarity detection module through the whole Blog06 dataset and split a document into 4 lists.Our selection of projects and contributors to GitHub projects using the pull-based model may not be indicative of the average project. Generalizability – Transferability.Construct: Are we asking the right questions ? Also  , the infrastructure we used for the analysis is available open source as a GitHub repository 5.As an example  , the popular Semantic Web search engine Sindice 8 is practically unusable for people without a deep understanding of semantic technologies. The majority of current tools are not aimed at non-expert users.We also aim at improving the OpenStreetMap data usage scenario  , e.g. Hence  , we envision some extensions to Triplify such as a more external annotation of the SQL views in order to allow optionally SPARQL processing on Triplify endpoints.We then examine 291 carefully selected Ruby  , Python  , Java and Scala projects in total  , 166 ,884 pull requests  , and identify  , using qualitative and quantitative analysis  , the factors that affect pull request lifetime  , merging and rejection. Using it  , we first explore the use of almost 2 million pull requests across all projects in Github.The tiny relation is a one column  , one tuple relation used to measure overhead. The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations.This potential participant can then request that code changes in their personal copy be merged into the project's main repository. GitHub allows potential project contributors to "fork" or make a personal copy of any public project where they can make changes to  , add  , or alter functionality  , without disturbing the code in the original branch.Results of the experiments run on the Gerbil platform are shown in Table 2. All these methods are tested in the setting where a fixed set of mentions is given as input  , without requiring the mention detection step.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology. We validated this set of triples against all OWL 2 profiles 4   , and we found that they are compatible.29  proposed GERBIL - General Entity Annotator Benchmark  , an easy-to-use platform for the agile comparison of annotators using multiple data sets and uniform measuring approaches. To avoid this problem  , the authors of Uzbeck et al.We used Github APIs to search 3 for SW repositories and to collect contact information for the corresponding contributors when available. Github is currently the most popular repository for open source code and its transparent environment implies a suitable basis for evaluating reuse and collaboration among developers 21.For these reasons  , we used GitHub in our recruiting efforts. GitHub is also a popular code hosting site with a large user base that could provide a relatively diverse pool of potential participants.The contrasting associations between popular projects and collaborators may indicate that audience pressure is a factor when project managers evaluate pull requests. Number of stars  , our proxy for project popularity  , is used by members of the GitHub community as a signal for project quality  , which project managers are aware of 5.We have implemented a URI-Key Generator  , more than one CDX Profiler  , and a script to merge profiles and published the code on GitHub 3 . The latter approaches involve more steps and setup  , but scale well.For popular projects  , the transparent nature of GitHub means project managers are aware  , at least in part  , of the identity of users of their project 5. The contrasting associations between popular projects and collaborators may indicate that audience pressure is a factor when project managers evaluate pull requests.17 reports findings on a number of metadata harvesting experiments. The OAIster system 16 is another example of a large-scale aggregation system.After creating the data files  , we investigated projects where the pull request merge ratio was significantly less than the one we calculated across Github 73%  , and in any case less than 40%  , as this means that our heuristics are not good enough for this project. If none of the above heuristics identifies a merge  , we mark the pull request as unmerged.By these means  , we allow benchmarking tools against reference datasets from any domain grounded in any reference knowledge base.  With GERBIL we introduce the notion of knowledge base-agnostic benchmarking of entity annotation systems through generalized experiment types.These flaws may be in part harming our approach focusing on individual permalinks' topical relevance. For example  , see BLOG06-feed-000065  , BLOG06-feed-001152  , etc.However  , as witnessed in the popular dataset registry DataHub 2   , dataset descriptions are often missing entirely  , or are outdated  , for instance describing unresponsive endpoints 7. To facilitate search and reuse of existing datasets  , descriptive and reliable metadata is required.In total  , 1 ,000 ,000 collaborative GitHub projects i.e.  , 45% of all collaborative projects used at least one pull request during their lifetime. As Figure 1 shows  , its popularity is constantly growing; in January 2016  , 135 ,000 repositories on the GitHub social coding site received more than 600 ,000 pull requests.However  , participants were free to use any of the other Blog06 collection components for retrieval such as the XML feeds and/or the HTML homepages. The retrieval units were the documents from the permalinks component of the collection  , where there is the post and comments related to it.The Melvyl Recommender project 8 analyzed server logs captured when users chose to view detailed information about certain documents  , and used those as the user profile when generating recommendations. The Ilumina project 7 provides recommendations based on document metadata  , available subject expert analysis of documents  , resource use as discovered in logs  , and user profiles for those users who are registered with the system.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github. Since exposure generation time dominates verification time  , we performed an additional experiment to test the scalability of the exposure generator more thoroughly.Since the categories are not mutually exclusive  , an article may be classified into any number of categories between zero and four. Given the full text of a scientific article   , a system should decide whether the article would support curation in each the following four categories: 1 Gene Ontology annotation The Gene Ontology Consortium  , 2000  , 2 the Mouse Tumor Biology Database 3 the Gene Expression Database  , and 4 the Alleles and Phenotypes category of the Mouse Genome Database.Both other approaches are not capable of representing historical data and only provide statistics for one point-in-time. The most distinguishing feature of SCOVO is the ability to express complex statistics over time while still keeping the structural complexity very low.However  , the absolute number indicates that semantic representations are not yet common in today'line in Figure 2cloud. Since the growth of documents in Sindice was closely related to upgrades in their technical infrastructure in the past  , we cannot reliably use their growth rate.These contributions may be less technically sound  , more complicated to evaluate  , or simply controversial in terms of project direction or implementation strategy. Changes that required high amounts of discussion tend to be more closely scrutinized by more members of the site  , as GitHub users would look at discussion on a contribution as a signal of controversy.Relationship taxonomies can refine a neighborhood-based similarity approach assuming that not only the neighbors of a concept influence in the similarity measure  , but also the relationship type used to infer that this concept is a neighbor. Figure 2a presents a taxonomy of relationships in the Gene Ontology GO.The URLs used in the experiment  , source code and response headers of all requests are available at https://github. Another important finding is that response patterns vary for different topics – sensitive topics result in a larger number of 403 forbidden responses.The configuration can determine the replay policies  , such as whether to emulate the networking latencies. In the replaying stage  , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet.Formally  , a gene within such genome is represented as a collection of three GF sets: mutated  , additional  , and inherited. For any concept ontology the root concept is assigned a genome.We utilized a GitHub dataset collected during prior work that contains information on prolific developers with a long and active contribution history 10. Prolific Developers.For each tag  , we then collected the 250 most recent articles that had been assigned this tag. We began by collecting the 350 most popular tags from Technorati .This discrepancy could be due to the domain of the projects analyzed. On the other hand  , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .To achieve this  , the concepts of LOD resources should be understood  , where lexical information about LOD resources can be used to mine such knowledge. In order to generate concept-based search results  , first the retrieved LOD resources from the Sindice search need to be categorized under UMBEL concepts.Therefore  , we will use our approach to calculate the similarity between target and current processes and show the influences of processes on different service qualities and dimensions. Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology FMA 10 or Gene Ontology 11 that can be used to structure processes with semantic information.In both datasets TSA significantly outperformed the baselines. The results using the WS-353 and Mturk dataset can be seen in Table 3.For example  , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization  , molecular function  , and biological process 1. One of the emerging trends is an effort to define semantics precisely through ontologies that attempt to capture concepts  , objects  , and their relationships within a biological domain.In comparison to earlier frameworks  , it extends the stateof-the-art benchmarks by the capability of considering the influence of NIL attributes and the ability of dealing with data sets and annotators that link to different knowledge bases. GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology.We make the new dataset publicly available for further research in the field. In contrast with the previous standard benchmark  , WS-353  , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below  , which eliminates subjective selection of words.Falcons  , Semplore  , SWSE and Sindice search for schema and data alike. Hermes performs keyword-based matching and ranking for schema resources such as classes and object properties.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was crawled based on datasets provided by Falcon-S  , Sindice  , Swoogle  , SWSE  , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework. They represent two very different kinds of RDF data.One of the issues that might need to be further investigated in this task is whether it is beneficial to use the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection  , instead of or in addition to the Permalinks component. Overall   , some of the deployed retrieval approaches achieved reasonable retrieval performances.This approach was introduced in 25 in 2008 and is based on different facts like prior probabilities  , context relatedness and quality  , which are then combined and tuned using a classifier. 7 They provide the source code for their approach as well as a webservice 8 which is available in GERBIL.For AIDA we downloaded the default entity repository that is suggested as reference for comparison. Spotlight and WAT are integrated in GERBIL by default  , whereas we manually downloaded Wikifier and AIDA and installed them on our server with its best settings.In particular  , we use Sindice search for querying the WoD and Sindice Cache for retrieving RDF descriptions of LOD resources 2. Given that indexing and caching of WoD is very expensive  , our approach is based on existing 3 rd party serives.However  , not all those projects are active: in the period Feb 2012 — Aug 2013  , the GHTorrent dataset captured events initiated by approximately 2 ,281 ,000 users affecting 4 ,887 ,500 repositories. As of August 2013  , Github reports more than 7 million repositories and 4 million users.Finally  , we report on the extent to which the 17 ,958 presumed splog feeds and their associated 509 ,137 spam posts  , which were injected into the Blog06 collection during its creation have infiltrated the pool. Figure 3a shows a scatter plot of opinion-finding MAP against topic-relevance MAP  , which confirms that the correlation is very high.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well. Maintenance.GO is a controlled vocabulary developed for describing functions of gene products in order to facilitate uniform queries across different model organism databases  , such as FlyBase  , Saccharomyces Genome Database SGD  , and the Mouse Genome Informatics MGI Database. To structure the information related to gene functions scattered over the literature   , a great deal of efforts has been made to annotate articles by using the Gene Ontology 1 GO terms.For example offering an RDF dump in N-Triples for semantic search engines such as Sindice 26 along a SPARQL-endpoint for cross-site query is a typical pattern. Note that in practice very often the approaches listed above are used in combination.The questionnaires and the script for the semi-structured interviews are available in a technical report 16. The final set of themes that emerged informed the third phase of our research: a validation survey sent to 10 ,000 GitHub users  , receiving over 1 ,200 responses.Information about trees and parks is extracted from OpenStreetMap. on whether the street is in or near a park.It is precisely this ability to access all blog entries that use a given tag that makes the analysis in this paper possible. Technorati also provides a RESTful 6  API that allows programmatic access to their data  , including the ability to find the top N tags  , find all articles that have been assigned a particular tag  , or all blogs that link to a particular URL.Ratings are implemented with a slider  , so Jester's scale is continuous. Jester has a rating scale from -10 to 10.It describes more than 16 ,000 gene and gene product attributes of a large number of organisms. instance  , the Gene Ontology 1   , which is widely used in life science  , contains 472 ,041 triples.The final set of themes that emerged informed the third phase of our research: a validation survey sent to 10 ,000 GitHub users  , receiving over 1 ,200 responses. We then employed axial coding  , iterating through our exploratory survey responses and interview transcripts  , to answer our research questions.The site offers both free open source project hosting and paid private hosting and is home to over ten million repositories 1. GitHub is a project-hosting site started in 2008 that brands itself as "Social Coding."A recent study showed that it is very difficult to improve opinion retrieval performance over a strong baseline on the Blog06 collection11 . When evaluating opinion retrieval systems therefore  , one must compare the Mean Average Precision MAP score of the opinion retrieval system with the MAP for opinionated posts of the baseline system.We introduce the Celestial tool 4 a cache/gateway for the OAI-PMH and Citebase 5 an end-user service that applies citation-analysis to existing OAI-PMH compliant eprint archives. The first part of this paper provides background about the OAI-PMH.A multilingual resource  , such as the one described above  , can be developed in two ways: 1 aquiring a large multilingual database  , such as the MELVYL database  , or 2 incrementally extracting information in the desired languages from multiple online catalog databases. The facilities that we will be concerned with in what follows are the Search Facility  , the Retrieval Facility  , the Explain Facility  , and the Browse Facility.Projects were taken from Github 15  , one of the largest public repositories of Java projects. for functional languages — would be less justified.The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 . The feature extraction and validation job builds upon the MapReduce programming model  , using Jpylyzer and SCAPE Control Policies.Github can automatically verify whether a pull request can be merged without conflicts to the base repository. Through Github facilities.8 GitHub user profiles  , confirm this consideration. In Fig.These ontologies encapsulating controlled vocabularies may be utilized in object models with defined data elements to describe and define entities. For example  , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization  , molecular function  , and biological process 1.Events include participating in issues  , pull requests  , and commenting on various GitHub artifacts. To measure prior interaction  , we counted the number of events before a particular pull request that the user has participated in for this project.The system displays the corresponding feed for each returned document i.e. A standard search system for documents on the Blog06 collection using the Terrier search engine 3  was provided by the University of Glasgow to help the participating groups in creating their blog distillation topics.They conducted a tworound survey with 21 and 749 GitHub integrators on what factors they consider in their decision making process to accept or reject a pull request. 12 explored the practices of pull-based development model.Sindice 1  , Watson 2  adopt keyword-based search and ranked result lists presentation of traditional Information Retrieval IR  , which is not very efficient for large volumes of data 3 . However  , current approaches e.g.We use the Gerbil testing platform 37 version 1.1.4 with the D2KB setting in which a document together with a fixed set of mentions to be annotated are given as input. Further   , we show an empirical comparison between PBoH and well known or recent competitive entity disambiguation systems .With both the ESA index and the proposed selectioncentric context language model pw|s  , c  , we can compute a selection-centric context semantic vector Vs  , c based on the centroid of the semantic vector of each term. To assess the quality of our ESA index   , we apply it to compute word relatedness on the widelyaccepted WS-353 benchmark dataset 12  , which contains 353 word pairs  , and our experiments show a Spearman's rank correlation of 0.735  , which is consistent to the previously reported numbers 16  , 17.We could not scale up the LSI module in time to handle the Genomics data  , so we only used the gene synonyms created from the Gene Ontology harvest and nouns and phrases identified by the NLP module to expand the queries. Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.This issue is partially due to the lack of automated mechanisms for generating reliable and up-to-date dataset metadata  , which hinders the retrieval  , reuse or interlinking of datasets. However  , as witnessed in the popular dataset registry DataHub 2   , dataset descriptions are often missing entirely  , or are outdated  , for instance describing unresponsive endpoints 7.To that end  , we have conducted a statistical analysis of millions of pull requests  , as well of a carefully composed set of hunders of thousands of pull requests from projects actively using the pull-based model. The goal of this work is to obtain a deep understanding of the pull-based software development model  , as used for many important open source projects hosted on Github.This open-source alternative mapping service also publishes regular database dumps. OpenStreetMap OSM.We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com. Applying our utility function to SVD leads to a new utility function SV D util in this paper.compared more than 15 systems on 20 different datasets. Using GERBIL  , Usbeck et al.To remedy this problem  , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph  , called Gene Ontology GO terms  , based on the contents of the published scientific articles. As a result  , it is extremely labor-intensive for biomedical researchers alone to collect the information relevant to their need  , since obtaining such information requires intensive reading.EconStor content has also been published in the LOD. Our research is based on the EconStor 2 repository  , the leading German Open Access repository for economics which is maintained by ZBW.This dataset contains the purchase history from 2004-01-01 to 2009-03-08. Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites  , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website  , shop.com  , for our experiments.A snapshot of this dataset was taken in March 2007 containing 263 ,619 publications and from this 36 previous monthly snapshots were generated with the first one March 2004 containing 174 ,786 publications. Citebase holds articles from physics  , maths  , information science  , and biomedical science and contains over 200 ,000 publications.Results for the analysis of the 2 ,404 OAIster query strings are given in Tables 4 and 5 below. Each of the remaining queries was then searched against the CIC metadata aggregation SQL database to determine whether the query resulted in any matches of the types described in Tables 1 and 2 above.This research targeted users of GitHub  , a popular code sharing site. The interviewees were from 9 geographic regions: North America  , Middle America  , South America; Europe; Africa; West Asia  , Central Asia  , East Asia; and Australia / New Zealand.To ensure compliance with lmer's modeling assumptions  , we also checked the QQ-plot for our model  , which showed good match with a normal of the current week  , relative to one's first ever recorded GitHub contribution . We conclude collinearity between our variables is not an issue.To answer these questions  , we performed an analysis of contribution from thousands of projects on the social open source project-hosting site GitHub. For example  , site designers may choose to make important signals more salient to developers.They also highlight that there is plenty of room for collaboration between IR and Semantic Search. These conclusions can be helpful to improve the performance of Semantic Search engine implementations based on Lucene  , such as Sindice  , Watson  , Falcons or SEMPLORE.In this paper we use the topic model for subject metadata enrichment of the OAIster collection. Further comparisons of these three methods are discussed in 14.We lay emphasis on Snomed ct which comprises about four hundred thousand axioms and is now a standardized clinical terminology adopted by health care sectors in several countries 13. Examples include the Gene Ontology  , the thesaurus of the US National Cancer Institute Nci  , the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine  , Clinical Terms Snomed ct  , and large part more than 95% of the Galen Medical Knowledge Base Galen.Thirty PHP scripts  , one Java program and a Ruby gem are now available for any use including commercial   , modification and redistribution by anyone wishing to generate BioRDF data  , or to improve the quality of RDF conversions currently used in Bio2RDF. GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking  , pull requests  , code commenting  , and merging.Their work does not involve a concrete implementation but does provide a useful conceptual framing for our work. They show  , using the Gene Ontology GO as an example  , how data can be retrieved based on the principles of immunity by expanding queries.The stream-based approach is also applicable to the full data crawls of D Datahub  , As small data sets  , we used A the full Rest subset 22 ,328 ,242 triples  , B an extract of the Datahub subset 20 ,505 ,209 triples and C an extract of the Timbl subset 9 ,897 ,795 triples 7 .In the replaying stage  , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet. Our benchmark meets all the aforementioned requirements.com/ConstantB/ontop-spatial/wiki/Shapefiles. We imported the Shapefiles into a PostGIS database and created virtual geospatial RDF views on top of them using Ontop-spatial  , as described at https://github.The decision of whether or not to harvest from aggregator repositories is made more complex because these aggregators contain records that are not currently available through OAI channels  , and they do not always contain all the records of a particular original repository. As an example  , a search performed in OAIster for " double-well Duffing oscillator " retrieves two records  , exactly the same  , but one was harvested from the arXiv.org Eprint Archive repository an original repository and one harvested from the CiteBase repository an aggregator.A response is evaluated as correct only if it exactly answers the question in an exhaustive but not overinformative way  , if it is the most recent correct answer i.e.  , globally correct rather than locally correct  , and if it is accompanied by a document ID from one of the two previously mentioned corpora supporting the answer. Blog06 is a set of homepage documents from late 2005 and early 2006.The proposed model was shown to be effective across five standard relevance retrieval baselines. We have evaluated the proposed method on the BLOG06 collection.Our analysis suggests that while following technical contribution norms for pull requests is associated with acceptance  , the social connections behind pull requests have even stronger associations. However  , in the environment of GitHub  , which is both transparent and equipped with social media functionality  , we also expect contributors to make use of the social connections that the environment makes salient.He became Principal Engineer for Technorati after working for both Apple and the BBC. He is Vice President of Web Services at BT.Some resources we considered using are the Gene Ontology  , the Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus   , and the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server. A better option would be to refine the parsing technique and consult additional resources in search of valid synonyms and related terms likely to co-occur with the terms in the topic description.MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category  , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 . TOXICITIES We manually created a thesaurus for this category  , containing 17 different toxic- ities.Section 2 provides a short description of the newly created Blog06 test collection. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.25 quantitatively investigated the characteristics of contributions in GitHub  , finding that contributions are relatively small 20 lines and processed very quickly submissions are accepted in less than a day. Gousios et al.Further details regarding the implementation of VmVm  , including a more detailed and technical discussion of the instrumentation passes performed  , are available in our accompanying technical report 8 or directly on GitHub 7. Both the ant and maven hooks that we wrote consist of only a single line of code: VirtualRuntime.reset  , which triggers the reinitialization process.So we can regard this task as a multi-class classification task. Those articles should be classified to four categories: Tumor biology  , Embryologic gene expression  , Alleles of mutant phenotypes and Gene Ontology.To ensure the practicability and convenience of the GER- BIL framework  , we investigated the effort needed to use GERBIL for the evaluation of novel annotators. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 4.For both real data sets  , our stack-based algorithms perform the N av algorithms. We have tested two sources of real data sets  , one is the relatively small gene ontology data 17K nodes and 23K edges  , and the other one is a 100MB XML document about 1.4M nodes and 1.6M edges produced by using the XMark 22 benchmark generator.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications. To the best of our knowledge  , there exists no previous benchmark which can automatically emulate the process of user Web surfing in a way fair to Web browsers.Examples include the Gene Ontology  , the thesaurus of the US National Cancer Institute Nci  , the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine  , Clinical Terms Snomed ct  , and large part more than 95% of the Galen Medical Knowledge Base Galen. The attractiveness of the EL family is twofold: on the one hand  , it is computationally tractable  , i.e.  , subsumption is decidable in polytime; on the other hand  , it is sufficiently expressive to formulate many life science ontologies.Even though small  , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead. Further developers were invited to complete the survey  , which is available at our project website .Figure 1 The least common denominator approach to metadata is insufficient to serve these multiple contexts  , and can be an inhibitor to meaningful partnerships. This enriched metadata could then be distributed to meet the needs of access services  , preservation repositories  , and external aggregation services such as OAIster.In Study 3 S3  , we analyze 100 randomly selected public GitHub repositories that use Java's Study 2 S2 is a pilot survey that gathers data from 11 developers who asked Java cryptography-related questions on Stack- Overflow.We used Github data as provided through our GHTorrent project 16  , an off-line mirror of the data offered through the Github API. Up to August 2013  , 1.9 million pull requests from more than two hundred thousand projects have been collected.The " Open Knowledge Extraction " challenge at ESWC 7 and frameworks such as GERBIL 28 are good systems to validate our approach. identification of locations  , actors  , times at hand.Whenever applicable  , We also used terms from SDMX extensions 19 which augment the Data Cube Vocabulary by defining URIs for common dimensions  , attributes and measures. It extends SCOVO 10 with the ability to explicitly describe the structure of the data and distinguishes between dimensions  , attributes and measures.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S  , Sindice  , Swoogle  , SWSE  , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework. They represent two very different kinds of RDF data.This was used both to evaluate the outcomes of the project  , and to help guide the future direction of Citebase as an ongoing service. As part of the project report a user survey 23 was conducted on Citebase.The transparent nature of GitHub also led developers to become acutely aware that their work actions had an audience. In some cases  , multiple rounds of comments were necessary in order to establish shared understanding.Perhaps because of the density  , and/or because the continuous scale introduces less quantization error in ratings  , Jester exhibits lower NMAE values than the other datasets we tested. Ratings are implemented with a slider  , so Jester's scale is continuous.In addition to listing the citing articles  , Citebase provides a summary graph of citations and downloads e.g.   , the articles cited by the current article  , articles that have cited the current article  , and articles co-cited alongside the current article.The main steps shown in Figure 1are the following: i dataset metadata extraction from DataHub; ii resource type and instance extraction; iii entity and topic extraction; iv topic filtering and ranking; and v dataset profile representation. In this section  , we provide an overview of the processing steps for generating structured dataset profiles.To ask respondents about their work habits before coding  , we provided them with a set of 7 questions based on our analysis of the literature and our vast GitHub experience with a 4-level Likert scale. r439 Work practices followed after coding.As an example  , a search performed in OAIster for " double-well Duffing oscillator " retrieves two records  , exactly the same  , but one was harvested from the arXiv.org Eprint Archive repository an original repository and one harvested from the CiteBase repository an aggregator. Because of this  , we have records in our system from original repositories and from aggregator providers collecting original repositories.It was shown tasks can be accomplished efficiently with Citebase regardless of the background of the user. " The report found that " Citebase can be used simply and reliably for resource discovery.One approach to aggregated search is to use different vertical searches images  , video  , news  , etc. Sig.ma  , which is a search application built on top of Sindice  , is positioned in another area more closely related to the " Aggregated Search " paradigm  , since it provides an aggregated view of the relevant resources given a query 6.For the Categorization task  , we only attempted the triage task using a Naïve Bayes classifier. We could not scale up the LSI module in time to handle the Genomics data  , so we only used the gene synonyms created from the Gene Ontology harvest and nouns and phrases identified by the NLP module to expand the queries.Their study presents an analysis of the 250 most frequently used Technorati tags. Brooks and Montanez 4 have studied the phenomenon of user-generated tags to evaluate effectiveness of tagging.It provides a unified set of terms for the annotation of gene products in different organisms. Gene Ontology GO 1 is a system of keywords hierarchically organized as a directed acyclic graph with three main categories – biological process  , cellular component  , and molecular function.We evaluated VmVm to determine the performance benefits that it can provide and show that it does not affect fault finding ability. We have integrated it directly with popular Java testing and build automation tools JUnit 2  , ant 5 and maven 6  , and it is available for download via GitHub 7.A study of these other communities would enhance the generalizability of our findings. Technorati.the various categories. Figure 1: Number of events detected in the GitHub stream.Using a mixed-methods approach survey+quantitative analysis of mined data we study this phenomenon . With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub  , another tier of context-switching becomes possible: switching between projects.Ideally  , only the contents and comments of blog posts should be extracted as permalinks contain a variety of information not necessarily related to the posts themselves   , such as advertisements. Before creating an index of the blog06 corpus  , we extract textual information from the permalink files.The primary input to our taxonomy generator is a collection of documents and  , optionally  , a taxonomy for a related domain e.g.  , the Agrovoc thesaurus or the Gene ontology. 2 Finally  , a small taxonomy with preferred root nodes can be supplied to guide the upper levels of the generated taxonomy.GERBIL abides by a service-oriented architecture driven by the model-view-controller pattern see Figure 1. The output of experiments as well as descriptions of the various components are stored in a serverless database for fastSwoogle allows keyword-based search of Semantic Web documents . Several systems have implemented text-based search over Semantic Web data: Swoogle 8  , SemSearch 14  , Falcons 5  , Semplore 22  , SWSE 10  , Hermes 18  , Sindice/Sigma 19 .Previous work 25 found that the median number of PRs across repositories is 2; in our sample and considering the initial selection of projects  , the smallest project had more than 400. Our selection of projects and contributors to GitHub projects using the pull-based model may not be indicative of the average project.The Sindice index does not only allow search for keywords  , but also for URIs mentioned in documents. This is performed via textual or URI search on the Sindice index and yields a set of of source URLs that are added to the input source URL set.For example  , using a crawler and Sindice  , LOD resources can be categorized offline by the proposed fuzzy retrieval model 8  , or other clustering methods also UMBEL linked data mappings can be used. After receiving results  , our system augments the results with UMBEL categorizations  , which can be performed offline or dynamically 9.The first part is conducted on an Orkut community data set to evaluate the recommendation quality of LDA and ARM using top-k recommendations metric. We divide our experiments into two parts.All features are calculated at the time a pull request has been closed or merged  , to evaluate the effect of intermediate updates to the pull request as a result of the ensuing discussion. 5  , presented evidence that social reputation has an impact on whether a patch will be merged; in our dataset  , the number of followers on Github can be seen as a proxy for reputation.Finally  , in the opinion retrieval task  , for each query  , the returned top 1 ,000 documents are re-ranked according to the score consisting of the topic relevance and the opinion sentiment strength. After that  , such classifiers are applied to the whole Blog06 corpus to generate an opinion polarity judgment list for all the documents  , combined with the corresponding sentiment strength within interval 0  , 1.To evaluate swim  , we trained the natural language model with 15 days of clickthrough data from Bing  , and learned structured call sequences from a corpus of 25 ,000 open-source projects from GitHub. This last thread is what is run online in response to a user query.To include further metadata  , annotator and corpus dimension properties link DataID 2 descriptions of the individual components. The six evaluation measures offered by GERBIL as well as the error count are expressed as qb:Measures.The process used by Github to select projects is not public  , but we believe it is orthogonal to our concerns  , and likely based on popularity and recency. Note that it is also not the full set of Maven projects  , since Github only returns 99 pages of search results.Falcons  , Swoogle and Sindice have at some point in time been available as public Web Services for users to query. Sindice  , Falcons and Hermes are formally evaluated over hundreds of millions of statements  , while Semplore is evaluated over tens of millions of statements.For example  , see BLOG06-feed-000065  , BLOG06-feed-001152  , etc. Another problem is  , although less frequent  , that the extracted URLs are sometimes not permalinks but hyperlinks to the web pages the blog posts are commenting on.GitHub also provides a set of social networking features. Of course  , project managers may also ignore the contribution  , leaving the pull request "open".The importance of this collaboration platform seems to be increasing  , as its founder has plans to extend the use cases beyond software development Lunden 2013 . For all these reasons  , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.Before creating an index of the blog06 corpus  , we extract textual information from the permalink files. Even though it was not utilized to produce official runs  , Figure 4presents a digest of the extraction algorithm for completeness.They divide the abstract in two parts: the first  , static part showing statements related to the main topic of the document  , and weighted by the importance of the predicate of the triple  , while the second  , dynamic part shows statements ranked by their relevance to the query. worked on snippet generation for a semantic search engine Sindice that indexes instance data 2.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page. Semantic Entity Embeddings: We store the semantic embeddings created with Word2Vec and Doc2Vec in our index to provide fast access.The GHTorrent dataset covers a broad range of development activities on Github  , including pull requests and issues. The data is stored in unprocessed format  , in a MongoDB database  , while metadata is extracted and stored in a MySQL relational database.Social coding sites e.g.  , GitHub 20  , Bitbucket 6   , and Gi- torious 21  offer the pull-based development model in conjunction with social media functions  , which allow users to subscribe to and/or visualize information about activities of projects and users and offer threaded asynchronous communication within PRs. Then the members of the project's core team the integrators are responsible for evaluating the quality of the contributions  , proposing corrections   , engaging in discussion with the contributors  , and eventually merging or rejecting the changes.All data sets are integrated in GERBIL and strongly differ in document length and amount of entities per docu- ment. In the following  , we present seven well-known and publicly available data sets which are used in our evaluation.The MGI first decides whether each new article is relevant to mouse genomics and so possibly amenable to GO annotation  , then any relevant GO codes are assigned together with the evidence for that code. The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process  , cellular component and molecular function.We sent an online survey to 851 GitHub users selected from the set of prolific developers described earlier. The survey participants reported development experience was 17.2 years on average median 15; range 7 to 40  , while their GitHub experience was 5.9 years on average median 6; range less than 1 to since GitHub was founded.Table 1presents the list of the crawled blogs. The fourth collection was obtained by crawling 9 popular blogs from the top popular list presented in Technorati Blog 1 .Their applications include disambiguation  , annotation and knowledge discovery. The TAP 7 ontology  , SWETO 1 or the Gene Ontology GO 2 on the other hand  , have a relatively simple logical model.Note that individual query strings can generate multiple matches in the database which in turn match multiple of the cases defined in Tables 1 and 2. Results for the analysis of the 2 ,404 OAIster query strings are given in Tables 4 and 5 below.Statements like " having BRCA1 gene mutation increases the risk of developing breast cancer by a factor of four " are the examples of the relative risk. Second  , the ontology models relative breast cancer risk  , i.e.  , the risk comparably to an average woman.For each type  , we extracted structured call sequences from 10 ,000 source files using the type. To evaluate swim  , we trained the natural language model with 15 days of clickthrough data from Bing  , and learned structured call sequences from a corpus of 25 ,000 open-source projects from GitHub.Table 3gives detailed descriptions of two topics in blog06 and blog07. Three topics get more than 200% improvement  , such as topic 946 +900%  , and only 6 topics get a little drop on performance.We study in this paper the problem of attributing revisioned content to its author  , and more generally  , to the revision where it was originally introduced. Code is another prominent example of revisioned content  , and one that is becoming common on the web  , thanks to the success of sites like GitHub  , where users can share their code repositories.Sig.ma  , which is a search application built on top of Sindice  , is positioned in another area more closely related to the " Aggregated Search " paradigm  , since it provides an aggregated view of the relevant resources given a query 6. Semantic Web search engines  , such as SWSE 5  , Swoogle 4  , Falcons 2 or Sindice 7  , are based on the common search paradigm  , i.e.  , for a given keyword query or more advanced queries the goal is to return a list of ranked resources based on their relevance.We Figure 2: The Overview of the system ran our opinion detection and polarity detection module through the whole Blog06 dataset and split a document into 4 lists. In our system we maintained two different indices  , one at the sentence level and the other at the document level.We estimate the number of in-links by iterating over all elements in AC and querying the Sindice 9 SPARQL endpoint for triples containing the concept's URI in the object part. Estimating the number of in-links and identifying the concepts without any in-links  , can indicate the importance of a concept.The pull-based development model  , in conjunction with the social media functions offered by GitHub  , makes contributions and their authors more prominent than in other contribution models. Transparency.It makes the distinction between the factors that should be known to a woman  , e.g.  , age  , family cancer history  , breastfeeding  , and those that can only be inferred on the basis of other factors or by the examination  , e.g.  , BRCA gene mutation  , breast and bone densities  , etc. The ontology defines risk factors that are relevant to breast cancer.Since the Web content  , user interactions  , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers  , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers. These interactions are emulated during benchmarking browsers by instrumented JavaScript which is independent of Web browsers.The user selects an article from the result set and its thesaurus-related metadata are retrieved to further support her refine the results Fig. 1  , " EconStor Results " .Examples of evidence codes include: inferred from mutant phenotype IMP  , inferred from direct assay IDA and inferred by curator IC. The Gene Ontology defines nine evidence codes.Followers – This measure is the number of followers a GitHub user has at time of data collection. For example  , users with lots of followers were treated as local celebrities.The Gene Ontology defines nine evidence codes. In MGI  , a gene is annotated with a GO code only if there is a document that contains evidence to support the annotation.To facilitate this  , the research community has come together to develop the Gene Ontology GO  , www.geneontology.org 3. One of the many key efforts is to annotate the function of genes.Opinion identification is accomplished by combining the four opinion modules that leverage various evidences of opinion e.g  , Opinion Lexicon  , Opinion Collocation  , Opinion Morphology. We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.The selected EconStor article and its related blog posts show a meaningful relationship. She can further filter out blog posts by date  , leaving only the most recent ones in the result set.Their motivation for this pre-computing was to deal with the non-availability of recursive querying capability in the RDBMS used which is not the case in Oracle. We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.Contrasting the social stigma in America where only young people are perceived to use popular social networks  , Orkut is part of society in Brazil  , as it is not only used by teenagers  , but parents  , relatives  , and even taxi drivers as well. In Brazil  , Orkut  , a popular social network  , is the most popular website in the country 3.From the table below we conclude further that SCOVO seems to be the best combination of flexibility and usability  , allowing to recreate the data-table structures with a reasonable degree of fidelity in another environment that is  , on the Web. Both other approaches are not capable of representing historical data and only provide statistics for one point-in-time.We frame our study in the context of multitasking across GitHub projects  , i.e.  , switching back and forth between multiple projects that one contributes to  , within a short period of time our operationalization below is one week. Research Questions.We combined: 1 an analysis and regression modeling of repository data  , to quantitatively examine the effects of multitasking and focus switching on productivity; and 2 a user survey  , to garner additional qualitative insight into the developers' perceptions of multitasking  , focus switching  , and their effects. We analyzed development activity and perceptions of prolific GitHub developers.Then  , for each search result LOD URI  , parallel requests are sent to the server for categorization of LOD resources under UMBEL concepts. Using these input queries  , our system search the WoD by utilizing Sindice search API 2 and initial search results from the Sindice search are presented to users with no categorization.The Gene Ontology 11  is a controlled vocabulary of terms GO codes describing gene product attributes. Human curators at MGI annotate genes and proteins with Gene Ontology GO codes based on evidence found in documents .Table 1compares the implemented annotation systems of GERBIL and the BAT-Framework. provide the source code 25 as well as a webservice.to the available blog post elements  , we conducted automatic indexing of posts based on the STW thesaurus 3 . This effectively brings blog posts at the same vocabulary level as publications from EconStor.As Figure 1 shows  , its popularity is constantly growing; in January 2016  , 135 ,000 repositories on the GitHub social coding site received more than 600 ,000 pull requests. '16  , May 14 -22  , 2016  , Austin  , TXFigure 1: Monthly growth of pull request usage on GitHub.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking  , pull requests  , code commenting  , and merging. In 2012  , we consolidated the set Bio2RDF open source 5 scripts into a single GitHub repository bio2rdf-scripts 6 .The same problem was found for BLOG06-feed-000036  , BLOG06-feed-000043  , and many others. For example   , BLOG06-feed-000017 is associated with no permalinks in 20051206/feeds-000.gz according to <PERMALINKS> tags  , but the feed actually contains several permalinks  , such as Http://www.MacHall.Com ?strip id=357.Using it  , we first explore the use of almost 2 million pull requests across all projects in Github. Our study is based on data from the Github collaborative development forge  , as made available through our GHTorrent project 16.We studied 10 OSS Java projects  , as shown in Table 1: among these are five projects from Github  , while the others are from the Apache Software Foundation. 43  , in which snapshots of the five Apache projects were taken atOAIster's collection has quadrupled in size in three years ---thus scalability and sustainability are a major focus in our evaluations. This functionality is only possible if we have reliable  , consistent and appropriate subject metadata for each of the ten million records in OAIster.To validate the identified codes  , all three authors applied them on a different set of pull requests  , compared results  , identified inconsistencies and retrofitted the initial selection of codes. We use open coding a grounded theory tool to come up with an inclusive set of reasons of why pull requests are not merged as follows: the first author read the pull request discussion on Github for randomly selected pull requests and summarized the reasons for closing them into one sentence per sample; during a second pass  , the descriptions were aggregated and codes were extracted .Our query translation algorithm has been implemented in our latest version of Morph  , which is available as a Java/Scala opensource project in Github 9 . Their details are available in the following sub-sections.For example  , project managers see an urgent need for automatic testing in their projects in order to maintain quality as the number of peripheral developers scales 23. We see in prior work about GitHub that there are certain contribution norms that signal a technically well-prepared contribution.API Documentation. A main advantage of our work is that we do not rely on one source of information  , but rather combine three di↵erent sources SO  , GitHub projects  , and developer surveys.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors  , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before. JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems. Easy integration of datasets: We also provide means to gather datasets for evaluation directly from data services such as DataHub. In particular  , we integrated 6 additional annotators not evaluated against each other in previous works e.g.  , 7.The approaches described in 17 and 19 extend upon the paradigm of simple entity search and try to generate interpretations of keyword queries which exploit the semantics available on the Linked Data Web. This led to semantic search engines  , such as Swoogle 5  , Watson 4  , Sigma 20 and Sindice 21  , which aim to index RDF across the Web and make it available for entity search.We take entities as keywords and analyse the searching results in the system. We define some patterns and values as Table 1: In ELC task  , homepages are in the Sindice dataset.With Sindice being discontinued in 2014  , no text-based Semantic Web search engine is widely available to the Semantic Web community today. Falcons  , Swoogle and Sindice have at some point in time been available as public Web Services for users to query.
