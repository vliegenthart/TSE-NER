Defining and validating usage-based metrics: MESUR defines a wide range of usage-based metrics  , calculates them for the established reference data set  , and assesses their validity and reliability. 4.However  , the approach leaves associations between deterministically encrypted attributes intact. 1 vertically partitions a database among two providers according to privacy constraints.We choose hotels in Amish Country because during our initial investigation many potentially suspicious hotels were present. We choose the top 20 hotels in Amish Country  , Lancaster County  , PA from Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.Figure 2: Family order traversal a breadth-first manner is as appropriate as traversing it in document order e.g. In this way we still manage to keep the sibling information intact without having to store whole levels of the tree during the traversal.Zhu  , Kraut  , and Kittur 2014 examine community survival as a function of multiple memberships within Wikia communities. In contrast  , our work performs a similar computational analysis   , but also identifies the platform and motivational factors involved.The " Open Knowledge Extraction " challenge at ESWC 7 and frameworks such as GERBIL 28 are good systems to validate our approach. identification of locations  , actors  , times at hand.Even though small  , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead. Further developers were invited to complete the survey  , which is available at our project website .LocusLink is most prominent source of publicly available information on genes. However  , it was not clear to us if these fields are of sufficiently high quality and how exactly we could make good use of them.ACSys made that data available in two ways. Nick Craswell developed software for extracting hyper-link connectivity information from WT2g.The evidence strongly suggests that " bank of america " should be a segment. In these examples  , although there are variations in the query words and documents  , the sub-sequence " bank of america " remains intact in all clicked documents.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection. Therefore  , if A is relevant and B  , A's sibling  , has similar content to A then it is likely that B is relevant a s w ell.We use our work on constructing the concept ontology for LabelMe 1 as an example to depict our algorithm: 1 Labels in LabelMe contain text information of dominant salient objects as well as their contours and locations  , but there are no explicit labels at the image concept levels 8. In this paper  , we have developed a semi-automatic scheme for concept ontology construction.Each thread in our corpus contains at least two posts and on average each thread consists of 4.46 posts. From the TripAdvisor data  , we randomly sampled 650 threads.To achieve this goal  , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks. To ensure the practicability and convenience of the GER- BIL framework  , we investigated the effort needed to use GERBIL for the evaluation of novel annotators.If an acronym included in the expanded query can locate in LocusLink its aliases  , the aliases are included and their weights are equal to the weight of the acronym. 2.In BlogPulse  , according to the splog detection methodology presented in 14  , the percentage of splogs is 7.48%. Some previous work has identified a certain fraction of splogs in these two datasets.If suggestions from outside the context cities are geographically irrelevant  , we should focus on finding other sources for suggestions in those cities where few are provided on Wikitravel. Is there a relation between the number of suggestions available in the context city and the number of suggestions that are geographically relevant ?For the term " TGFB " in topic 14  , for instance  , the expansion techniques in stage 1 produce 185 candidates including lexical variants. We believe that this is mainly because the number of alias symbols provided by the LocusLink database is overwhelming.In fact  , the extension seems more likely to increase reusability  , e.g.  , by allowing researchers to analyse their system's performance over topics that best match their intended search context. The extension proposed in this paper keeps the original test collection documents  , topics  , relevance judgments completely intact.Overall  , our approach attains the best averaged F1 value of all systems. The corresponding GERBIL result sheet is available on the GERBIL website 4 and can be used to make comparisons to our approach in future evaluations.The See category is overrepresented in the top 5  , whereas the Eat and Drink categories are underrepresented . In Table 6 we see the distribution of Wikitravel categories over the top 5 retrieved suggestions and over all suggestions in the index.Shown below is a plot of correlations between ratings for all pairs of jokes computed over the ratings posted by these users. The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.The assessors checked the number of relevant documents in the Web collection once they had a candidate topic from searching the ad hoc collection. NIST assessors referred to the WT2g collection during the process of ad hoc topic generation.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98. But this scheme is computationally intensive: Onm  , where m is the number of users in the database.Based on CI we provided a conceptual comparison between the different UI adaptation approaches as shown in Table 3. As for our method  , CI is always = 0 since we use runtime adaptation hence the UI representation e.g.  , HTML pages will remain completely intact at design-time.On the other hand  , the first rank of the Model-Text suggestion is the WikiTravel page of the state of Michigan that is judged as a relevant suggestion. It is so interesting to know that the Model-Anchor suggests the WikiTravel page of the Kalamazoo city that is judged as an irrelevant suggestion in the first rank.While manually detecting irregularities for this data might be difficult  , examining the distribution of the pt values cf. 4 In Figure 7 we have already illustrated the distribution of ratings over time for the hotel Punta Cana Princess evaluated on TripAdvisor.Along with novel models of scholarly evaluation  , advances in semantic network analysis algorithms and large-scale data management techniques have and will continue to be produced. Furthermore  , the MESUR project aims to contribute to the study of large-scale semantic networks.Since RAID has an inlinite MlTF for disk errors  , there are no crashes which leave disk data unreadable. To recover from a crash where the disk is intact  , one need only abort all transactions alive at the time of the failure  , an instantaneous operation.The primary objective of the MESUR project is to study the relationship between usage-based value metrics e.g. TheA portion of a sample LocusLink entry is shown in The relevance judgements were obtained from the LocusLink database 11.Since OpenStreetMap is a prominent example of volunteered geographic information VGI 7  , LinkedGeoData knowledge reflects the way in which the environment is experienced 8 . LinkedGeoData uses the information collected by the OpenStreetMap project with the aim of providing a rich integrated and interlinked geographic dataset for the Semantic Web.We used a set of 9 ,403 recent MEDLINE documents associated with LocusLink GeneRIF records. Thus  , we decided that finding best sentences in the corresponding MEDLINE citations might serve the purpose of the secondary task.Besides metadata properties like titles  , descriptions and authors  , the source files of the open datasets themselves are linked as dcat:Distributions  , allowing Table 2: Datasets and their formats. GERBIL uses the recently proposed DataID 2 ontology that combines VoID 1 and DCAT 21  metadata with Prov- O 20 provenance information and ODRL 23  licenses to describe datasets.Although it is the responsibility of the Sender to inform the Receiver of his doubt  , an intact communication within the team of the Receiver can help to recognize the mistake Fig. 4  , Requirement 15.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 . In the experiments we use one graph instance for each targeted application area  , i.e.  , product recommendation on shopping websites  , collaborator and patent recommendation in academia  , friend recommendation on social networks  , and personalized web search.If the structure remains intact  , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree. Usually  , when a web page changes  , either the structure of the document or its content remains largely unchanged.By comparing against this gold standard  , we evaluate the lexicons constructed using different methods. In this section  , we describe how we create a gold standard by performing human annotation on a data set of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor.how strong / often are " new york times " and " subscription " associated and the application e.g.  , whether query segmentation is used for query understanding or document retrieval. For segments like new york times subscription  , the answer of whether it should be left intact as a compound concept or further segmented into multiple atomic concepts depends on the connection strength of the components i.e.In comparison to earlier frameworks  , it extends the stateof-the-art benchmarks by the capability of considering the influence of NIL attributes and the ability of dealing with data sets and annotators that link to different knowledge bases. GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology.100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server  , " beatitude. " For example  , a DNS-based Our experiment showed high reliability for archiving using NNTP.The MESUR project will proceed according to the following project phases: 1. It will do so by creating a large-scale reference data set in the form of a semantic network that relates usage  , citation and bibliographic data at a scale that is intended to be representative of the scholarly community.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service  , Wookieepedia  , about the Starwars universe. In this article  , we refer to this sample as WPEDIA.The paper is structured as follows: We motivate the need for a simple RDB-to-RDF mapping solution in Section 2 by comparing indicators for the growth of the Semantic Web with those for the Web. Additionally  , we employed Triplify to publish the 160GB of geo data collected by the OpenStreetMap project.As it is known that the frequency of folksonomy data usually follows a power-law distribution 18  , this approach would allow statistical attacks if applied to a folksonomy. However  , the approach leaves associations between deterministically encrypted attributes intact.In particular  , OpenStreetMap OSM is an initiative for crowdsourcing map information from users. In conjunction with the widespread use of smartphones and GPS enabled devices  , this has resulted in a large number of RDF datasets containing geospatial information  , which is of high importance in several application scenarios  , such as navigation  , tourism  , and location-based social media.Others may be allowed to use the content only if left intact  , only for non-profit purposes  , or they might be allowed to manipulate it  , provided the original source is acknowledged  , for example. Users can license their content via Creative Commons with varying degrees of rights.We have presented a client-side architecture for the enforcement  , creation and testing of browser security policies. Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy  , but the application functionality remains intact.The MESUR ontology was engineered to make a distinction between required base-relationships and those  , that if needed  , can be inferred from the baserelations . Finally  , the proposed ontology was engineered to handle an extremely large semantic network instantiation on the order of 50 million articles with a corresponding 1 billion usage events.This approach was introduced in 25 in 2008 and is based on different facts like prior probabilities  , context relatedness and quality  , which are then combined and tuned using a classifier. 7 They provide the source code for their approach as well as a webservice 8 which is available in GERBIL.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors  , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before. JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.This enhancement enables a variety of new Linked Data applications such as geo data syndication or semantic-spatial searches. The publication of the OpenStreetMap data using Triplify adds a completely new dimension to the Data Web: spatial data can be retrieved and interlinked on an unprecedented level of granularity.This article presents  , the OWL ontology 17 used by MESUR to represent bibliographic  , citation and usage data in an integrated manner. Mining such a vast data set in an efficient  , performing  , and flexible manner presents significant challenges regarding data representation and data access.For each query in the query set  , all the points in the training set are ranked according to the Hamming distance between their binary codes and the query's. We perform Hamming ranking using the generated binary codes on the CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets.This systems extracts suggestions for sightseeing  , shopping  , eating  , and drinking from Wikitravel pages dedicated to US cities. These ranked suggestions are then filtered based on the context.The second data set further referred to as Hotel consists of reviews of hotels crawled from TripAdvisor 5 along with the meta-data of review authors   , such as location  , gender and age 6 . This first data set further referred to as Auto consists of reviews crawled from FordForum.com 4   , a public automobile on-line review website  , which provides the meta-data of review authors  , such as location  , gender and occupation in this work  , we are only interested in location and gender.Otherwise  , we leave the trees intact. Notice that we merge two trees T i   , T ′ i only if a third tree has been propagated from level i − 1.Creating a reference data set: MESUR has invested significant energy to compile a large-scale col- 1 Pronounced " measure "   , an acronym for " Metrics from Scholarly Usage of Resources " . 1: 1.The two methods described in this section focus the user's display on their current context e.g.  , mediaeval history. The use of this system is investigated in Section 5.use  , it is designed at a level of generality that does not directly support the granularity required by the MESUR project. author  , and action e.g.Each review provides a general rating of the hotel  , plus provides seven individual ratings on the following service characteristics: Value  , Room  , Location  , Cleanliness  , Service  , Check-in  , and Business Service. Hotel service characteristics: We extracted the service characteristics from the reviews from TripAdvisor.Detailed results are also provided 1112 . Results of the experiments run on the Gerbil platform are shown in Table 2.As mentioned above  , we maintain a KB with a large number of instantiations made against the AKTRO. Even though some of these instances might not be required for running some of our applications  , they represent an important and resourceful part of the KB and can be considered as a type of ontology use  , and hence it was deemed important to make sure that all these instances remain intact.It is based on a large and active community contributing both data and tools that facilitate the constant enrichment and enhancement of OSM maps. In particular  , OpenStreetMap OSM is an initiative for crowdsourcing map information from users.The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations  , which we indexed using Indri. Using a tf-idf measure  , we extracted the top 30 keywords for each example website  , that could serve as queries.One participant searched for " Japanese anime " Observation J3 but was only interested in videos with associated English audio  , while Participant D was interested only in Chinese content with the original audio intact. Of course  , the language of a video's audio might be altered from the original  , and whether this change has occurred can affect a video's acceptability to a given user.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links. First a connectivity server was made available on the Web.The bins were then distributed to first-pass assessors who  , equipped with detailed assessment guidelines largely compiled from the relevance guidance that the Topic Authority had provided the teams in the course of the exercise  , assessed the documents in their bins for relevance to their assigned topics. Some bins had more  , some less  , than 500 documents  , due to the fact that messages were assigned to bins intact parent email together with all attachments  , making it impossible to see that every bin had exactly 500 documents.The requirement to handle a variety of semantic relationships publishes  , cites  , uses and different types of content bibliographic data  , citation data  , usage data  , led MESUR to define a context-centric OWL ontology that models the scholarly communication process 19 3 . Unique identifiers for these items are shared among these storage infrastructures and allow jumping from one to the other as needed.The OpenStreetMap project has successfully applied the Wiki approach to geo data. In addition to using Triplify for publishing RDF from the long tail of million of Web applications deployed  , we evaluated the software with the very large datasets produced by the OpenStreetMap project 14 .From Figure 3   , it is easy to see that LabelMe and TinyImage have different characteristics. Please note that the authors of ANN_SIFT1M provide only the extracted features without any original images of their data.Youngstown travel guide -Wikitravel " . For City Youngstown  , OH  , its Wikitravel page is " 2.52 % of these links reference another document within WT2g but only 0.12 % reference a different server within WT2g. On average  , each document within the collection includes 9.13 outgoing links.First  , we prepare the training data and testing data  , including those GeneRIFs existed in LocusLink and the corresponding Medline abstracts. The key issue is how to get function words and introducers and how to measure such scores.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents  , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data. The Disk4&5 collection contains newswire articles from various sources  , such as Association Press AP  , Wall Street Journal WSJ  , Financial Times FT  , etc.  , which are usually considered as high-quality text data with little noise.Thus  , we find English  , Chinese and Russian languages to be strongly represented as the location segmentation implies. This is not surprising  , as the BlogPulse blog data was used as a source set of blog urls for harvesting blog author profiles.Point annotations  , for example  , are originally stored as comma separated property-values assignments in a BLOB column within the database. In order to publish the OpenStreetMap data  , we performed some preprocessing of the data structures.We perform Hamming ranking using the generated binary codes on the CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets. This is because the number of iterations needed to learn U decreases as the code length increases.Let M be the output annotations of an entity disambiguation system on the same input. Note that in all the results reported  , mentions that contain NIL or empty ground truth entities are discarded before the evaluation; this decision is taken as well in Gerbil version 1.1.4.Actually  , when we use the truncated query model instead of the intact one refined from relevance feedback  , the MAP is only 0.304. This does not contradict the fact that the latter yields higher retrieval performance.While developing GERBIL  , we spotted several flaws in the formal model underlying previous benchmarking frameworks which we aim to tackle in the future. More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website.by better interlinking the data with other Linked Data datasets and providing a proper ontology for querying. We also aim at improving the OpenStreetMap data usage scenario  , e.g.The Jester dataset comes from Ken Goldberg's joke recommendation website  , Jester 10. The standard deviations in all estimates are less than 0.25 %.We extracted site-internal links from all the States  , Regions  , Cities  , Districts and Burroughs sections. We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US  , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.The curve below shows how cross-validation NMAE varies with model size k and number of users m. To the left of the curve  , it is clear that high k leads to large errors  , implying that the model is over-fitting. For Jester  , which had a high density of available ratings  , the model was a 300-fold compression.2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism. We collected the MEDLINE references as described before  , LocusLink has a set of references to MED- LINE documents relevant to the gene for documents corresponding to each organism in LocusLink.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US  , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list. These are provided by a community of travellers and locals and can be used as a source for contextual sugges- tions.Figure 3 shows some representative images sampled from LabelMe and TinyImage data sets. We conduct our experiments only on the database subset  , which consists of 1 ,000 ,000 images each represented as 128-dimensional SIFT de- scriptors.For each section  , first we extract all bold phrases. Wikitravel Page = the i th document  , where Table 2The "See" section of document "Houma travel guide -Wikitravel" After retrieving one city's Wikitravel homepage  , we examine the " See "   , " Do "   , " Eat "   , " Drink " and " Buy " sections in that page  , and extract famous venues from these sections.From the Wikia service  , we selected the encyclopedias Wookieepedia  , about the Star Wars universe  , and Muppet  , about the TV series " The Muppet Show " . From now on  , we refer to this encyclopedia as WPEDIA.F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2. Assuming the catalog entry is still accessible and still refers to the document  , three conditions must be met in order to recover its content: 1.IDF was calculated on the corpus of all 429 ,183 blog posts from the 4th July that were contained in the original Blogpulse corpus. a5 derives from the observation that because of the rich context of blogs  , captured for example in hyperlinked sources  , important terms may not actually be frequent in the post itself  , such that their being unusual high IDF creates a better indicator of importance 10.However  , since the MESUR usage data doesn't identify individual users  , usage co-occurrence was reformulated in terms of sessions  , indi-cated by anonymized session identifiers: the degree of relationship between any pair of journals is a function of the frequency by which they are jointly accessed within user ses- sions. This relationship is known as usage co-occurrence  , and it is used to create MESUR's journal usage networks.The assessment of scholarly impact is now largely a matter of expert opinion or metrics derived from citation data  , e.g. This poster provides an overview of the MESUR project's workplan and architecture  , and will show preliminary results relating to the characterization of its semantic network and a range of usage-based impact metrics.It is not known at this stage  , what proportion of the dead links those whose target lies outside WT2g are inter-server links and how many are references to same-server pages which happen to be missing from the VLC2 1 . 52 % of these links reference another document within WT2g but only 0.12 % reference a different server within WT2g.We highlight our contributions and key results below. In our study  , we use more than 15M reviews from more than 3.5M users spanning three prominent travel sites  , Tripadvisor   , Hotels.com  , Booking.com spanning five years for each site.Furthermore  , the MESUR project aims to contribute to the study of large-scale semantic networks. This model can be juxtaposed to the citation-driven monoculture that presently prevails in the assessment of scholarly status.The most common indicator of journal status is Thomson Scientific's journal Impact Factor IF that is published every year for a set of about 8 ,000 selected journals. 7 The MESUR website offers detailed information on metric definitions and abbreviations: http://www.mesur.org/Figure 1: Overview of MESUR project phases. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.The mean partitions the block access distribution more effectively than an approach based on percentiles since  , paradoxically  , it is less affected by clustered values. Thus both clusters are left intact.From the work of Kleinberg in 7  , it is generally accepted that for queries on broad topics  , Connectivity Analysis will allow for the selection of the most popular densely linked documents from within a WWW community in response to a query  , in addition to automatic result clustering. We do suggest caution being taken when reviewing the Small Web Task to take the results in the context of the WT2g dataset  , lest one conclude that Connectivity Analysis does not improve precision in any case.To determine the probability that a GeneRIF would be found in a particular position  , we annotated a set of 200 MedLine entries from LocusLink associated with GeneRIFs. We created a score algorithm for which the output was the sentence with the highest probability of being a GeneRIF.The six evaluation measures offered by GERBIL as well as the error count are expressed as qb:Measures. Each observation features the qb:Dimensions experiment type  , matching type  , annotator   , corpus  , and time.A significant amount of data processing must be performed to turn the heterogeneous usage data collections obtained from a variety of sources into a reference data set that provides a solid basis to perform cross-source analysis: 1. In certain cases  , the usage data is provided by the source in an anonymized form  , in other cases MESUR is responsible for the required processing.This is in the spirit of the Slice heuristics keeping slices intact and at the same time gives the biggest hope to minimize the total number of database resets. As a consequence  , T 5 is executed on M 1 .This open-source alternative mapping service also publishes regular database dumps. OpenStreetMap OSM.The doc id is a internally generated identifier created during the MESUR project's ingestion process. Note that the connection between the bibliographic record and the usage event occurs through the doc id bolded properties.We conduct experiments on eight standard collections  , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100  , AP88-90 with queries 51-150  , FBIS with queries 351-450  , FT91-94 with queries 301-400  , LA with queries 301-400  , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150  , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450. The number of topics Kt is set to be 400 as recommended in 15.The key point of our recovery paradigm is that we would like to leave the effects of the dependent transactions intact while preserving the consistency of the database  , when undoing the compensated-for transaction. of T  , and are referred to as a set using the notation depT.Table 1compares the implemented annotation systems of GERBIL and the BAT-Framework. provide the source code 25 as well as a webservice.In the following  , we present current state-of-the-art approaches both available or unavailable in GERBIL. Currently  , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features  , capabilities and experiments.The sources of the stored documentation are thus very varied ; in the case of the existing prototype mediaeval history of France the sources include : original documents  , learned contemporary works  , articles from journals  , etc. Firstly  , the information stored in the system's database is not in the form of "documents" in the usual sense of the term "full text" or bibliographical references but in the form of "facts" : every "episode" in the lives of our personages which it is possible to collect and represent.Hilliness. Its score depends on the number of shops  , bars  , restaurants  , and parks on the street extracted from OpenStreetMap and on the street's type.The MESUR project attempts to fundamentally increase our understanding of usage data. Indeed  , most existing research into usage-based metrics of scholarly impact focuses on single metrics whose characteristics are explored on the basis of usage data that has been recorded for particular scholarly communities.This poster provides an overview of the MESUR project's workplan and architecture  , and will show preliminary results relating to the characterization of its semantic network and a range of usage-based impact metrics. The final project outcome will be the publication of guidelines with regards to the properties of various usage-based impact metrics  , and how they can be appropriately applied.OntologyX uses context classes as the " glue " for relating other classes  , an approach that was adopted for the MESUR ontology. The principles espoused by the OntologyX 5 ontology are inspiring.Let D be any database and let D be obtained from D by possibly modifying the measure attribute values in each fact r arbitrarily but keeping the dimension attribute values in r intact. An allocation policy is said to be measure-oblivious if the following holds.By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples  , we created personalised category prior probabilities. This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying  , doing  , drinking  , eating and seeing.Hypothesis 2 was posed to provide understanding of whether teachers' varying level of teaching experience influenced the desire to customize materials versus download them intact. Teachers indicated only a slight preference for web sites that show ratings by other users or for online teaching resources they don't have to modify 3.61.BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection. Therefore   , it is fair to compare them on these four collections.The preliminary results discussed in the following sections were generated on the basis of an early subset of the MESUR data set that was selected to offer the best possible outcomes at the time:  200 million article-level usage events: A subset consisting of the most thoroughly validated and deduplicated usage events. However  , the timeconsuming process of aggregation  , filtering  , parsing  , and deduplicating 1 billion usage events was terminated only recently .but outperforms several supervised methods  , achieving the state-of-the-art performance. However  , our unsupervised method not only surpasses the unsupervised methods  , Table 1: MAP scores of unsupervised SCSM and other methods on the Pascal VOC  , Wiki  , Wiki++ and LabelMe datasets  , while CDFE  , GMMFA  , GMLDA  , LCFS and JFSSL are supervised methods.See Figure 4for an example of the results generated by a query "Vegetable Soup Recipes". Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact. In Section 8  , all effectiveness measures except NDCG treat judgments of 1 and 2 as relevant.These interactions are emulated during benchmarking browsers by instrumented JavaScript which is independent of Web browsers. In WPBench  , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.Since MESUR follows an approach of usage data analysis inspired by clickstream concepts 12  , 11 grouping events is an essential processing sub-task that needs to be performed before ingesting the usage data into the reference data set. Session-based grouping: Usage data is typically recorded and hence provided to MESUR as a time-sequential list of individual events recorded by an information system; different events generated by the same agent in the course of a certain time span are not grouped.Please note that the authors of ANN_SIFT1M provide only the extracted features without any original images of their data. Figure 3 shows some representative images sampled from LabelMe and TinyImage data sets.Thus  , we choose a 60 day period from 01/01/2009 to 03/01/2009 for our experiments. In TripAdvisor   , t win is about 60 days.Altogether  , the need to recall queries and repeat lengthy search processes is abolished. In addition  , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions  , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.For BRIGHTKITE  , PDP captures essentially all of the likelihood. In all cases  , personalization captures over 75% of the available likelihood.The entry provided by UMLS for the phrase " mad cow disease " is " bovine spongiform encephalopathy  , bse  , bovine spongiform encephalitis "   , excluding the variants generated by varying the form or order of the words. An example for the LocusLink lexicon is that the acronym " psen1 " corresponds to a list of aliases " ps-1  , pre1  , psen  , zfps1  , zf-ps1 " .However  , the relationship between the number of reviews and the number of hotels Figure 3c is below an ideal straight line for the first few points  , since there are surprisingly few hotels with fewer than 50 reviews. TripAdvisor 1-star  , 2-star  , 3-star  , 4-star  , 5-star distribution of the number of reviews per reviewer Figures 4c also follows a power law.In Table 6 we see the distribution of Wikitravel categories over the top 5 retrieved suggestions and over all suggestions in the index. However  , the examples from the Eat category were rated even higher but fail to push Eat suggestions to the top of the ranking.Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success. Zhu  , Kraut  , and Kittur 2014 examine community survival as a function of multiple memberships within Wikia communities.They concluded that CORI  , and a modified version of the CORI algorithm  , performed reasonably effectively at the server selection task. 5 evaluated CORI  , vGlOSS  , and CVV in a testbed based on the 2GB  , 956 server WT2g crawl of the Web.In contrast  , our work examines a fundamentally different setting where communities are actively competing with each other for users and the unique content they bring. Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success.Table 4presents one positive seed review from TripAdvisor. Both the similar reviews are negative and contain negative words like " horrible "   , " bad "   , " nauseous " which are synonyms to " awful " in the seed.The configuration can determine the replay policies  , such as whether to emulate the networking latencies. In the replaying stage  , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet. dimacsAw20w5: Representation: Windows with halfwindow size 20  , selected using LocusLink information. Upweighting of positive examples: yes w = 5.can be reconstructed in a unique manner in future works. Hence  , by using GERBIL for experiments  , tool developers can ensure that the settings for their experiments measures  , datasets  , versions of the reference frameworks  , etc.Table 2 shows the statistics of our test corpora. All data sets are integrated in GERBIL and strongly differ in document length and amount of entities per docu- ment.the entire WT2g Dataset  , both for inLinks and outLinks. Using recently acquired hardware we have reduced this time to below 2 seconds per query.It is so interesting to know that the Model-Anchor suggests the WikiTravel page of the Kalamazoo city that is judged as an irrelevant suggestion in the first rank. Second  , the reason of the difference between the average M RR of Model-Anchor and Model-Text for the profile 700 is his/her judgment in " Kalamazoo MI " context.We do suggest caution being taken when reviewing the Small Web Task to take the results in the context of the WT2g dataset  , lest one conclude that Connectivity Analysis does not improve precision in any case. It is our understanding that any implementation of these approaches would not succeed in improving precision to any usable extent  , if at all when the experiments were based on the WT2g dataset  , due to the lack of Functional links.To keep the data dependencies intact   , a more complex definition of ~ results  , which is given here without explanation for the amusement of the reader:  Applying improved array conditions to PC45  , 21 in figure 1 has the following effect. In the example   , it could be that i = j  , violating the data dependence definition for 1 ~ 3.By these means  , we allow benchmarking tools against reference datasets from any domain grounded in any reference knowledge base.  With GERBIL we introduce the notion of knowledge base-agnostic benchmarking of entity annotation systems through generalized experiment types.Therefore  , we make estimation from the crawled posting data. However  , accurate estimation of visit probabilities is impossibile due to the lack of login and browsing data of TripAdvisor users.However  , these datasets do not include multilingual CH metadata. GERBIL can be used with systems and datasets from any domain.The ranking is based on about 1.5 million usage events. Table 1lists the five highest-ranked journals according to their usage 5 at LANL  , one of the initial usage data sets in the MESUR reference data set.Since the Web content  , user interactions  , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers  , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers. These interactions are emulated during benchmarking browsers by instrumented JavaScript which is independent of Web browsers.compared more than 15 systems on 20 different datasets. Using GERBIL  , Usbeck et al.From the TripAdvisor data  , we randomly sampled 650 threads. From the source data  , we generated two datasets for question identification.We investigated the effort to implement a BAT-framework adapter in contrast to evaluation efforts done without a structured evaluation framework in Section 4. Due to the community effort behind GERBIL  , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9.A static cache determines items to be cached based on previous usage statistics and keeps the cache content intact until the next periodic update. The caching strategies can be broadly categorized as either static or dynamic 9.However  , the Clarksville is not mentioned in the anchor text of the Nashville wikitravel page  , and it is reasonable that it is not included in the top-5 ranking of the Model-Anchor. Due to the fact that the Nashville is just 47.8 miles further than the Clarksville in the state of Tennessee  , this page is judged as a relevant suggestion.However  , GERBIL is currently only importing already available datasets. 28 The extensibility of the datasets in GERBIL is furthermore ensured by allowing users to upload or use already available NIF datasets from DataHub.Our survey comprised five developers with expert-level programming skills in Java. To achieve this goal  , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.We started by identifying all the distinct hosts represented in the 100 gigabyte collection. The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.The MESUR ontology is currently at version 2007-01 at http://www.mesur.org/schemas/2007-01/mesur abbreviated mesur. The following sections will describe how bibliographic and usage data is modeled to meet the requirements of understanding large-scale usage behavior  , while at the same time promoting scalabil- ity.The i-th record in the pointer file selects the inverted list which corresponds via the qualification to the Ds value associated with the i-th record of the original file. That is  , the original file is left intact  , and a file of pointers is added.To include further metadata  , annotator and corpus dimension properties link DataID 2 descriptions of the individual components. The six evaluation measures offered by GERBIL as well as the error count are expressed as qb:Measures.Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink. Thus  , for more effective retrieval  , we looked at ways to expand our query.This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying  , doing  , drinking  , eating and seeing. Per geographic context the ranked suggestions are filtered on location.If our service returns a NIL annotation  , GERBIL treats it like " not annotated " . We note that the GERBIL version that we use does not consider NIL annotations when computing the F1  , recall and precision values.An interesting ontology-based approach was developed by the Ingenta MetaStore project 19. use  , it is designed at a level of generality that does not directly support the granularity required by the MESUR project.In our study  , we use more than 15M reviews from more than 3.5M users spanning three prominent travel sites  , Tripadvisor   , Hotels.com  , Booking.com spanning five years for each site. We provide True- View as a proof of concept that a cross-site analysis can significantly improve the information that the user sees.However  , the timeconsuming process of aggregation  , filtering  , parsing  , and deduplicating 1 billion usage events was terminated only recently . The MESUR reference data now consists of 1 billion individual usage events that were recorded at the documentlevel and processed as described above.It is helpful to the work of conducting the GeneRIF in LocusLink database. This paper proposed automatic approaches to extract gene function in the literature.The value of entities updated by both T and its dependents should reflect only the dependents' updates. The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .The rootbased algorithm is aggressive. When no root is detected  , the algorithm retains the given word intact.The distribution is somewhat different over the 50 examples than over the Wikitravel suggestions. Of the 50 examples  , 10 are assigned to the Buy category column 4 in Table 1  , 12 to Do  , 7 to Drink  , 9 to Eat and 12 to See.The online version of GERBIL can be accessed at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil. More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.We imported the Shapefiles into a PostGIS database and created virtual geospatial RDF views on top of them using Ontop-spatial  , as described at https://github. However  , it was more convenient for us to download the most up-todate original OpenStreetMap data about Bremen  , available as Shapefiles 10 .This is not surprising  , as the BlogPulse blog data was used as a source set of blog urls for harvesting blog author profiles. The match between geolocation and language improves when we compare location breakdown with the language breakdown for blogs collected by BlogPulse in October 2006.Additionally  , these datasets contain textual reviews  , which we used to understand and describe the results of our method. The data consists of the IDs of the products/services to be rated as well as the related user IDs who evaluated them with star rating scores from 1 up to 5 at different timesteps in the case of TripAdvisor  , the rating scores range from 0 up to 5.Although we felt that the 100GB collection would be more useful as a research tool  , we didn't have the storage capacity available to handle such a large dataset at that time. Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset  , consisting of 247 ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.When no root is detected  , the algorithm retains the given word intact. In the root-based algorithm  , the main aim is to detect the root of the given word.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems. In the context of the project ELVIRA  , a tool for generating statistical correlation relations based on parallel corpora was implemented.BRIGHTKITE. For privacy reasons  , we only consider pages clicked on by at least 50 distinct users  , and only consider users with at least 100 clicks.We first collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor 8 for four travel intentions including Beaches & Sun  , Casinos  , History & Culture  , and Skiing. Comparing the two graphs in Figure  6a andWhile our previous work 7 helped to automate database tasks related to persistence of JavaScript objects  , it did not handle the runtime state of function closures  , event-handlers  , or HTML5 media objects that we addressed in this paper related to the migration of running browser sessions. The automated and generic nature of our instrumentation makes our approach transparent and helps developers keep their original source code intact. To reduce maturation effects  , i.e. Consequently the original datasets were left intact.We split the data into training and test sets with approximately 9000 users in each. Perhaps because of the density  , and/or because the continuous scale introduces less quantization error in ratings  , Jester exhibits lower NMAE values than the other datasets we tested.The images are 32 × 32 pixels and we represent them with 512-D GIST descriptors. The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60 ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.  , airplane  , bird  , cat  , deer.In the AcroMed lexicon  , entries are indexed by technical terms or phrases  , and each entry is a list of acronyms associated with the corresponding technical term/phrase  , accompanied by the frequencies of such associations. The data provided by AcroMed 4   , LocusLink 5   , and UMLS 6 are processed to create three lexicons.OntologyX also helped to determine the primary abstract classes for the MESUR ontology. The context construct is intuitive and allows for future extensions to the ontology.GER- BIL will regularly check whether new corpora are available and publish them for benchmarking after a manual quality assurance cycle which ensures their usability for the implemented configuration options. However  , GERBIL is currently only importing already available datasets.1 The analysis consisted of gathering classifications from different human annotators and from different IR / text mining methods and semantic resources  , and of quantitative and qualitative analyses of their outputs. This paper addresses these questions by an empirical analysis that uses a part of a standard blog corpus: the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006.Actually  , full-fledged functional templating is supported only by MediaWiki and Wikia which is MediaWikibased . A first fact is the different support between creational and functional templates: about a half of the clones adopt a creational approach  , while less than a fifth adopt a functional one.The corresponding GERBIL result sheet is available on the GERBIL website 4 and can be used to make comparisons to our approach in future evaluations. Table 3 shows the F1 values in comparison to the competitor systems on all data sets.The recommendation engine in Jester 1.0 retrieved jokes using nearest neighbor search. Based on the data gathered  , we developed a new recommendation algorithm that runs in linear time.I would like to express my appreciation to the secretary of ECPA  , Yola de Lusenet  , for her input and suggestions during the preparation of this paper. The question  , therefore  , will not be how and when the latter will take over  , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact  , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework. Thereafter  , we present the GERBIL framework.In the figure  , we plotted the results for an exemplary hotel from the TripAdvisor database. In Figure 4  , we analyze the effect of a varying λ on the runtime.Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset  , we had to take this possibility into account. Regardless of the topic in question these sites would be ranked highest due to the number of inLinks associated with them.The match between geolocation and language improves when we compare location breakdown with the language breakdown for blogs collected by BlogPulse in October 2006. In particular  , our projections suggest that Chinese and Russian should appear prominently in the language based segmentation.Furthermore  , the extended ontology includes the mappings resulted by the schema matching. The spatial data is collected by the OpenStreetMap 5 project and it is available in RDF format.For WebKB dataset we learnt 10 topics. For SRAA dataset we learnt 10 topics on the complete dataset and labeled these 10 topics for all the three classification tasks.Due to the fact that the Nashville is just 47.8 miles further than the Clarksville in the state of Tennessee  , this page is judged as a relevant suggestion. On the other hand  , Model-Text provides the wikitravel page of the " Nashville " city in the state of Tennessee as the 1st suggestion in the ranking.Overlap and Distance features will capture this splitting and reordering. c The phrase " do not contain 834 " is kept intact in P 1   , but is split apart in P 2 .Datasets: CIFAR-10 3 and Tiny 100K image 8 datasets both encoded with GIST features. Finally  , we then find the optimal value for the flexibility of margin C ∈ {0.01  , 0.1  , 1.0  , 10  , 100}.Figure 6shows these curves as a function of the cache size k for MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE  , and for comparison  , SHAKE- SPEARE and YES. We also compute a separate baseline to account for the most heavily consumed items: we calculate and report the fraction of hits when the cache is fixed to always contain the top k most frequently consumed items.In this work  , we assume a Trusted Computing Base TCB consisting of correctly booted and functioning hardware and a correctly installed operating system and DBMS. The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.NPQ is orthogonal to existing approaches for improving the accuracy of LSH  , for example multi-probe LSH 7  , and can be applied alongside these techniques to further improve retrieval performance. Figure 3: 1 LSH PR curve for 22k Labelme 2 LSH AUPRC on 22k Labelme 3 LSH PR curve for CIFAR-10 4 LSH AUPRC for CIFAR-10 5 LSH PR curve for 100k TinyImages 6 LSH AUPRC for 100k TinyImages ment of quantisation thresholds.Clearly  , the recency only model is the second best and the improvements by the hybrid model over the recency model are significant for MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE. For computational efficiency reasons  , we learn recency weights over the previous 200 positions only.The integrity of a record relates to its wholeness and soundness: a record has integrity when it is essentially intact and uncorrupted. Knowledge of all these attributes is essential to establish the identity of any record.Algorithm 2 needs to use AcroMed and LocusLink databases for query expansion. Algorithm 1 is very simple  , easy to implement and don't need any external biomedical resource.BRIGHTKITE. We describe each of the datasets in detail below.These preliminary results already provide a tantalizing preview of the possibility of usage-based metrics of impact that are more adaptive  , more timely and more accurate than any other assessment metric that is presently available. This result strongly suggests that usage-based impact rankings may further converge as MESUR ingests its entire collection of 1 billion usage events  , but that this convergence may very well be towards a notion of scholarly prestige different than the one expressed by the IF.Hotel service characteristics: We extracted the service characteristics from the reviews from TripAdvisor. We extracted these characteristics within an area of 0.25-mile  , 0.5 mile  , 1-mile  , and 2-mile radius.For the baseline system  , suggestions are ranked per user profile based on their positively rated examples and filtered on the geographic context. By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples  , we created personalised category prior probabilities.In the UMLS lexicon  , entries are indexed by technical terms or phrases  , and each entry is a list of synonyms associated with the corresponding technical term/phrase. In the LocusLink lexicon  , entries are indexed by acronyms  , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms.This did change the statistically significant pair found in each data set  , however. The rest of the order was preserved intact.Furthermore  , the combination of GRH+NPQ outperforms the adaptive thresholds allocation model VBQ of 3 by a relative margin of 27%. For example  , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.The model which optimizes per-item scores without recency outperforms the model that fixes the per-item scores to be item popularity over all datasets. Clearly  , the recency only model is the second best and the improvements by the hybrid model over the recency model are significant for MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE.We determine the effectiveness of our algorithm in relation to semi-supervised text classification algorithm proposed in 5 NB-EM. We randomly split SRAA and WebKB datasets such that 80% is used as training data and remaining 20% is used as test data.We opt for leaving the fully utilized instances intact as they already make good contributions. The idle instances are preferred candidates to be shut down.It is accessible at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil/ experiment ?id=201503050003 visualizations  , 30 see Figure 2 . Next to individual configurable experiments  , GERBIL offers an overview of recent experiment results belonging to the same experiment and matching type in the form of a Table 5: Results of an example experiment.For the ease of presentation   , we highlight the clusters by different colors such that the size and shape of the clusters are clearly illustrated in the figures. All figures are generated by our modified version of Java OpenStreetMap Editor 2 which is a map editor for OpenStreetMap 3 written in Java.Table 8shows the results of all of the single-pass retrieval methods on three collections. Table 7: Optimal hyper-parameter on all retrieval methods over both types of verbose queries tuned for MAP on WT2g.The operative unit for stratification was the message  , and messages were assigned intact parent email together with all attachments to strata. Stratification followed the submission-based design noted above Section 2.1  , whereby one stratum was defined for messages all participants found relevant the " All-R " stratum  , another for messages no participant found relevant the " All-N " stratum  , and others for the various possible cases of conflicting assessment among participants.So far  , MESUR reached agreements for the exchange of usage data with 14 parties  , and as a result has compiled a data set covering over 1 billion article-level usage events  , as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data. As a result  , it is possible to extract the various articles that users requested a service for in the course of a given session   , and to reconstruct the clickstream of these users in the information system that recorded the usage data.However   , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster. This means that as users became more overloaded  , they replied to a smaller fraction of incoming emails and with shorter replies.We have built a prototype of a hosting platform that implements the above ideas  , including the changes to the Linux kernel of the hosting servers to provide the above OS functions . To this end  , we introduce two new OS functions  , allowing the enacting agent  , which we refer to as local controller   , to explicitly swap in or out a suspended AppServ  , while leaving intact normal paging for active tasks.The search results from the different database systems are not combined together in any fashion and duplicate citations from different services are not eliminated. All subsequent links pass through the proxy server and are redirected to the vendor system with session connection information intact.It turned out that ruling out terms Figure 1 : MAP and P@10 for short queries at different pruning levels  , baseline and different settings WT2g collection   , as those terms have a negative score for every document.For SHAKESPEARE  , since the consumption is contrived  , there is no recency the real and permuted curves are near-identical  , which both validates our measure as capturing the amount of repeat consumption  , and shows that the separations in MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE are nontrivial . Interestingly  , caching on the permuted sequences is still higher on this measure than the stable top-k cache  , suggesting that temporally " local " preferences recently consumed items are more important than temporally " global " preferences all-time favorites.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset  , consisting of 247 ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements. In order to test whether the associated hypothesis is true  , we developed a software application which would produce results based on conventional Content Analysis the baseline result and then re-rank those results based on a number of related Connectivity Analysis approaches.Additionally  , we employed Triplify to publish the 160GB of geo data collected by the OpenStreetMap project. We tested and evaluated Triplify by integrating it into a number of popular Web applications.Future work will present benchmark results of the MESUR triple store. While a trim ontology has been presented  , the effects of this ontology on load and query times is still inconclusive.In order to generate user profiles the ratings users gave for the example attractions along with the created vectors that represent each sample attractions are combined and passed to the Softmax algorithm. This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions.The principles espoused by the OntologyX 5 ontology are inspiring. As a result  , in order to improve triple store query efficiency  , MESUR stores such data in a relational database  , and the MESUR ontology does not explicitly represent these literals.Figure 1provides a general overview of the the various stages of the MESUR project. The MESUR project will develop metrics using various algorithms drawn from graph theory  , semantic network theory  , and statistics  , along with theoretical techniques developed internal to the project and cross-validated with existing metrics such as the ISI IF  , the Usage Impact Factor 3  , and the Y-Factor 1.More precisely  , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database  , either from a Medline record or from the entire article. The main purpose of the genomic secondary task was to address the bioinformatic community's information extraction needs.Most images in LabelMe contain multiple objects. With the help of this annotation tool  , the current LabelMe data set contains as large as 200 ,790 images which span a wide variety of object categories.With the help of this annotation tool  , the current LabelMe data set contains as large as 200 ,790 images which span a wide variety of object categories. LabelMe is a web-based tool designed to facilitate image annotation.GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology. The persistent URIs enhance the long term quotation in the field of information extraction.Section 2 describes the size  , origin  , and representation of the MESUR reference data set. This article introduces preliminary results from the MESUR project  , all of which strongly confirm the potential of scholarly usage data as a tool to study the dynamics of scholarship in real time  , and to form the basis for the definition of novel metrics of scholarly impact.On the other hand  , we found that unifying designlevel similarities with XVCL is almost always beneficial  , as it considerably reduces perceived program complexity. For example  , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data. Due to the lack of In addition to topics 401-450  , we have executed a number of manual queries on the software.The Ionosphere Database consists of 351 instances with 34 numeric attributes and contains 2 classes  , which come from a classiication of radar returns from the ionosphere . We used the Ionosphere Database and the Spambase Database.First 100 elements obtained from three different ranking methods  , tf -idf   , BM 25  , and Rejection are pair-wise compared in Figure 5. Documents in both D1 and D2 Figure 5 are drawn from dataset collection WT2G where |D1| = |D2| = 2500  , |T1| = 50961 and |T2| = 127487.Finally we calculate the cosine similarity score 2 between the extracted phrase p and each retrieval document's title t j   , and keep the document with the highest score as the Wikitravel page for that city. for City Youngstown  , OH  , we get phrase " Youngstown Ohio travel guide " .We observe an interesting behavior: Starting from very small values of λ  , an increase in λ also increases the runtime. In the figure  , we plotted the results for an exemplary hotel from the TripAdvisor database.In this way we still manage to keep the sibling information intact without having to store whole levels of the tree during the traversal. Figure 2shows an example of a family order traversal.They may still be restored with edits intact simply by loading them." If I were to open this icon  , I would see: "The following files were edited but not saved.Recency is clearly present in MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE  , and absent from SHAKESPEARE and YES. iii SHAKESPEARE iv YES Figure 6: Normalized hit ratio as a function of cache size for four different datasets.This paper addresses these questions by an empirical analysis that uses a part of a standard blog corpus: the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006. Q5 Last but not least  , which computational and empirical methods are suited to analyzing these questions ?Moreover   , partial results are not considered within the evaluation. To address this problem  , we aim to develop/implement novel measures into GERBIL that make use of scores e.g.  , Mean Reciprocal Rank.Nick Craswell developed software for extracting hyper-link connectivity information from WT2g. It is not known at this stage  , what proportion of the dead links those whose target lies outside WT2g are inter-server links and how many are references to same-server pages which happen to be missing from the VLC2 1 .His visual fields are intact. Neurological: He is awake and alert.To alleviate this problem  , GERBIL allows adding additional measures to evaluate the results of annotators regarding the heterogeneous landscape of gold standard datasets. At the moment  , those measures ignore NIL annotations   , i.e.  , if a gold standard dataset contains entities that are not contained in the target knowledge base K and an annotator detects the entity and links it to any URI  , emerging novel URI or NIL  , this will always result in a falsepositive evaluation.To account for potential measurement errors when matching social media data with streets  , we add a buffer of 22.5 meters around each street's polyline. To describe those segments  , we rely on data gathered and distributed for free by OpenStreetMap OSM a global group of volunteer cartographers who maintain free crowdsourced online maps and by Ordnance Survey the national mapping agency for Great Britain.As a result  , in order to improve triple store query efficiency  , MESUR stores such data in a relational database  , and the MESUR ontology does not explicitly represent these literals. in the triple store  , as done by Ingenta  , is not essential.In addition  , we define constraints to forbid impossible value assignments for t1  , . That is  , it reduces the values proposed by untrustworthy sources to utterly uncertain values P cv = eq = 1/2 if pt = 0  , while keeping the values of trustworthy sources intact P cv = eq = c if pt = 1.However  , our unsupervised method not only surpasses the unsupervised methods  , Table 1: MAP scores of unsupervised SCSM and other methods on the Pascal VOC  , Wiki  , Wiki++ and LabelMe datasets  , while CDFE  , GMMFA  , GMLDA  , LCFS and JFSSL are supervised methods. This is because supervised methods rely on semantic labels to reduce the semantic gap of different modalities  , but unsupervised methods only use pair-wised information.This paper has described preliminary results derived from an analysis of a subset of the MESUR reference data set that consists of over 200 million article-level usage events. This reference data set forms the basis for a program aimed at the identification  , validation and characterization of a range of usage-based metrics.Further developers were invited to complete the survey  , which is available at our project website . Moreover  , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.We have not yet fully exploited that ability in AQuery. Reductions help find syntactically simpler forms of an expression while keeping its semantics intact.The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60 ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.  , airplane  , bird  , cat  , deer. Given a query image  , the images sharing at least one common concept with the query image are regarded as the relevant ones.Compensation undoes T's effects in a semantic manner  , rather than by physically restoring a prior state. The key point of our recovery paradigm is that we would like to leave the effects of the dependent transactions intact while preserving the consistency of the database  , when undoing the compensated-for transaction.All data sets are integrated in GERBIL and strongly differ in document length and amount of entities per docu- ment. In the following  , we present seven well-known and publicly available data sets which are used in our evaluation.which is a global quantity but measured locally. After excluding splogs from the BlogPulse data  , weTable 9gives the numbers of directly and indirectly relevant documents. The WT2g connectivity data see http://pastime.anu.edu.au/WAR/WT2g_Links/ilink_WTonly.gz and the Small Web qrels file were used to find the set of documents which link directly to relevant documents.The Wookieepedia collection provides two distinct quality taxonomies. These are the two Wikia encyclopedias with the largest number of articles evaluated by users regarding their quality.Opinion identification is accomplished by combining the four opinion modules that leverage various evidences of opinion e.g  , Opinion Lexicon  , Opinion Collocation  , Opinion Morphology. We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.We also performed a stand-alone ground truth evaluation of collusion and adjusted agreement. The method penalizes mirrors and near mirrors   , whereas genuine agreement between the sources is kept intact.However  , the mean is a poor statistic to describe the power-law distributions of links on the web; average linkage is dominated by the many pages with few links and gives little insight into the topology. They concluded that linkage in WT2g was inadequate for web experiments.Previous work summarizes the threats that can affect the metadata catalogue 4. If a failure  , disaster or intentional attack affects the metadata catalog  , it can cause a total data loss  , even if the data stored on the other nodes remain intact.Formal releases of these two broswers are expected to fix these problems. All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.This diagram primarily serves as a reference. Figure 6 presents the complete taxonomy of the MESUR ontology.We have considered in the same class also other wikis  , such as WackoWiki  , TikiWiki  , and OddMuse  , which support functional templating without parameter passing i.e. Actually  , full-fledged functional templating is supported only by MediaWiki and Wikia which is MediaWikibased .For segments like new york times subscription  , the answer of whether it should be left intact as a compound concept or further segmented into multiple atomic concepts depends on the connection strength of the components i.e. Ideally  , each segment should map to exactly one " concept " .If conflicts occur e.g.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections  , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated. Then the algorithm deletes the tuples already labeled  , repeats the same procedure for the remaining tuples  , and labels sections produced in each step as B  , C  , D and so on.17 That is  , the AIDA team discourages the use because they constantly switch the underlying entity repository  , and tune parameters. The authors publish a key-protected webservice 14 as well as their 43  , GERBIL will not use the webservice since it is not stable enough for regular replication purposes at the moment of this publication .The Blog06 test collection includes a crawl of feeds XML  , associated permalinks HTML  , retrieval units  , and homepages during Dec 2005 through early 2006. 50 test topics  , each consisting of title phrase  , description sentence  , and narrative paragraph fields  , were constructed using queries from commercial blog search engines e.g.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.This allows for a quick comparison of tools and datasets on recently run experiments without additional computational effort. It is accessible at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil/ experiment ?id=201503050003 visualizations  , 30 see Figure 2 .However  , an intact partnership between Sender and Receiver would provide an open communication between them and prevent information hiding. 5.The design philosophy for query construction is to leave Ithe external simplicity of keyword approaches intact  , and rely on internally complex retrieval mechanisms to transcend keyword matching algorithms. A query in CODEFINDER can consist of keywords  , category labels  , attributes  , or an example database item.The precision of manual annotation may be well guaranteed  , but it has some difficulties in the practical applications since we are facing Web-scale images and Web-scale concepts. The LabelMe project 19 also presents a tool to users to help manually assign tags to local regions of the images .First  , conditions which constrain a variable to a small discrete interval are automatically translated into a disjunction of possible values. To keep the data dependencies intact   , a more complex definition of ~ results  , which is given here without explanation for the amusement of the reader:  Applying improved array conditions to PC45  , 21 in figure 1 has the following effect.all the incoming and outgoing links  , and for different values of the parameter λ  , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus Savoy 01. Fixing the parameter λ to 0.1 and k to 5  , the final retrieval status value of D 4   , noted RSVD 4   , will be :In this paper  , we presented and evaluated GERBIL  , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks. In the future  , we also plan to provide information about the point in time since when an annotator is stable  , i.e.  , the algorithm underlying the webservice has not changed.It provides detailed information about the function and position of genes. LocusLink is most prominent source of publicly available information on genes.The similar reviews include similar expressions such as " would definitely return "   , " will definitely return " . Table 4presents one positive seed review from TripAdvisor.By integrating such a large number of datasets  , experiment types and frameworks  , GERBIL allows users to evaluate their tools against other semantic entity annotation systems short: entity annotation systems by using exactly the same setting  , leading to fair comparisons based on exactly the same measures . GERBIL is an opensource and extensible framework that allows evaluating tools against currently 9 different annotators on 11 different datasets within 6 different experiment types.We believe that this is mainly because the number of alias symbols provided by the LocusLink database is overwhelming. It is surprising that adding gene information from euGenes and LocusLink deteriorates the mean average precision comparing rows Heuristics&AcroMed and All of the above in Table  3   , although the additional data increases the recall from 5 ,284 to 5 ,315 relevant documents.These are the two Wikia encyclopedias with the largest number of articles evaluated by users regarding their quality. From the Wikia service  , we selected the encyclopedias Wookieepedia  , about the Star Wars universe  , and Muppet  , about the TV series " The Muppet Show " .Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results  , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact. in the previous tables  , we see that generally both Recall and Precision are better on the sets s than for ~; here the exception is for the set ~ n ~  , for which precision is higher than for both z n S3 -d SI n %  , due to the large number of elements in this set 73% of the terms considered.This strategy is also more in line with intuition. and WT2g.Jester provides a simple HTML client that allows any user having a computer with intemet connectivity and a browser supporting frames to access the system. Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.To illustrate the effects of some of these design considerations figure 1shows three precision curves obtained using the WT2g collection and short queries. To be more concrete  , we present next some of the precision vs. pruning results using standard MAP and P@10 measures.In order to do this  , the MESUR project makes use of a representative collection of bibliographic  , citation and usage data. on the basis of scholarly usage.It aims to pave the way for an inclusion of usage-based metrics into the toolset used for the assessment of scholarly impact and move the domain beyond the longestablished and often disputed IF. The MESUR project attempts to fundamentally increase our understanding of usage data.For article features  , we normalized URL and Editor categories together  , and kept the CTR term a real value intact . For user features  , we normalized behavioral categories and the remaining features age  , gender and location separately   , due to the variable length of behavioral categories per user.While a trim ontology has been presented  , the effects of this ontology on load and query times is still inconclusive. The MESUR project was started in October of 2006 and thus  , is still in its early stages of development.In WPBench  , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications. Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.Figure 1 shows the relation between the number of suggestions in the context city and the fraction of geographically  There is a clear relation between the number of suggestions available in a city and the P@5G score. If suggestions from outside the context cities are geographically irrelevant  , we should focus on finding other sources for suggestions in those cities where few are provided on Wikitravel.Creative Commons is the most promising approach to the intellectual property problems  , which are otherwise a roadblock to progress in the use of educational technology. Others may be allowed to use the content only if left intact  , only for non-profit purposes  , or they might be allowed to manipulate it  , provided the original source is acknowledged  , for example.Table 4: Retrieval examples by tags queries on the LabelMe database by the proposed method. It can be concluded that SCSM can achieve a comprehensively better performance among unsupervised methods.The proposed poster is divided into two primary components . Another significant component of the MESUR project is the development of a scholarly ontology that represents bibliographic  , citation  , usage concepts  , along with concepts for expressing different artifact metrics.Given both usage and bibliographic data  , it will be possible to generate and validate metrics for understanding the 'value' of all types of scholarly artifacts. The purpose of the MESUR project is to study usage behavior in the scholarly process and therefore  , usage modeling is a necessary component of the MESUR ontology.Information about trees and parks is extracted from OpenStreetMap. on whether the street is in or near a park.We also aim at improving the OpenStreetMap data usage scenario  , e.g. Hence  , we envision some extensions to Triplify such as a more external annotation of the SQL views in order to allow optionally SPARQL processing on Triplify endpoints.GERBIL abides by a service-oriented architecture driven by the model-view-controller pattern see Figure 1. The output of experiments as well as descriptions of the various components are stored in a serverless database for fastUsing normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6  , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10. For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets  , we randomly sample 1 ,000 points as query set  , 1 ,000 points as validation set  , and all the remaining points as training set.This design also allowed for a clear separation between architectural and system-level concerns. The design of the middleware's architectural support recall Figure 3 remained intact as we ported it from Java to C++.For our English baselines  , relevance feedback improved the title-only queries  , but did not appreciably change when longer topic statements were used. In Table 5 we report the percentage of mean average precision achieved by each bilingual run performed with intact translation resources when pre-translation expansion was not used.Table 7: Optimal hyper-parameter on all retrieval methods over both types of verbose queries tuned for MAP on WT2g. Figure 2: Performance trend MAP as the single smoothing hyper-parameter λ  , µ  , and ω changes for each language model on the WT2g tuning collection for description only queries top and for description and narrative queries bottom.Given a concurrent execution of a set of transactions i.e.  , an interleaved sequence of operations compensation for one of the transactions  , T  , can be modeled as an attempt to cancel the operations of T while leaving the rest of the sequence intact. In the classical transaction model only the sequences are dealt with  , whereas the programs are abstracted and ire of little use.As a second future work  , we plan use our motif framework as a way to analyze other evolving collaborative systems  , such as non- Wikimedia Wikis  , such as Wikia and Conservapedia  , which have very different editing policies and user bases. Further  , the network representation could be expanded to include editor interaction on the Talk pages  , which might reveal collaborative sequences such as Talk page discussion followed by article revision.Applications of social influence in social media. We adapt the E-M algorithm of Saito  , Nakano  , and Kimura 2008 to extract social influence in TripAdvisor  , and use it as input to our participation maximization algorithm.We extract a set of tourist attractions in the metadata of OpenStreetMap. A large value of F1 measure indicates a better clustering.Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.   , d -1 all the children of the old node n whose parent edge weight was congruent to i mod d.The proposed MESUR ontology is practical  , as opposed to all encompassing  , in that it represents those artifacts and properties that  , as previously shown in 4  , are realistically available from modern scholarly information systems. This article presents  , the OWL ontology 17 used by MESUR to represent bibliographic  , citation and usage data in an integrated manner.Beyond the social values associated with the online forums  , the owners of the forums also directly benefit from the traffic of active forums  , e.g. discussing travel experiences in TripAdvisor.The approaches in the literature for event representation can be divided to two groups: The first approach describes an event in the sentence level by an intact text or individual terms 5  , 36. Illustration of more such events can be see in Figure 5.The main advantage of n-grams over tokens is the capability to detect subwords such as " watch "   , without requiring an explicit list of valid terms. For example  , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "   , " llwat "   , " lwatc "   , " watch "   , " atche "   , " tcher " and " chers "   , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.This result is statistically significant based upon a paired t-test across 10 random training/testing partitions of the dataset p-value: ≤ 1.7 × 10 −5 . We find a 33% performance gain over MQ for LSH-based projections for 22k Labelme.When considering whether the content of a lengthy video might be personally interesting to the participant  , small snippets of the original video can be invaluable. One participant searched for " Japanese anime " Observation J3 but was only interested in videos with associated English audio  , while Participant D was interested only in Chinese content with the original audio intact.GeneRIF snippets sometimes contain direct quotations from article abstracts but they might also include or paraphrase certain texts extracted from article titles or abstracts. More precisely  , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database  , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.Section 3 discusses initial findings in the realm of sample bias  , and Section 4 shows the first ever map of science created on the basis of a substantial scholarly usage data set. Section 2 describes the size  , origin  , and representation of the MESUR reference data set.To describe those segments  , we rely on data gathered and distributed for free by OpenStreetMap OSM a global group of volunteer cartographers who maintain free crowdsourced online maps and by Ordnance Survey the national mapping agency for Great Britain. We consider the area of Central London  , which consists of 3 ,368 street segments.To do so  , we test against three publicly available image datasets: 22k Labelme consisting of 22 ,019 images represented as 512 dimensional Gist descriptors 8; CIFAR-10 a dataset of 60 ,000 images represented as 512 dimensional Gist descriptors ; and 100k TinyImages a collection consisting of 100 ,000 images  , represented by 384 dimensional Gist descriptors  , randomly sub-sampled from the original 80 million tiny images dataset. We evaluate the effectiveness of NPQ in the domain of image retrieval  , although our approach is general and can be used for other types of data for example  , text  , video.Table 1lists the five highest-ranked journals according to their usage 5 at LANL  , one of the initial usage data sets in the MESUR reference data set. This assumption seems to be confirmed by the pattern that emerges as the MESUR reference data set grows and becomes more diverse over time.article metadata  , and a triple database 4 to store and query semantic relationships among items. Therefore  , the MESUR project uses a combination of a relational database to store and query item e.g.The spatial data is collected by the OpenStreetMap 5 project and it is available in RDF format. The goal of LinkedGeoData is to add a spatial dimension to the Semantic Web.More details and further experimental results are available at http://swa.cefriel.it/geo/eswc2016.html. Furthermore  , according to global OpenStreetMap statistics 1   , Italy and UK are ranked 7th and 10th for number of created spatial objects  , and 4th and 5th for density of created spatial objects per square kilometer.It would be useful to delete such a sentence  , while leaving the rest of the sequence intact  , but as yet we have not given this matter enough attention to know whether such a procedure would be safe. For instance  , an otherwise tidy sequence of sentences may include one which contains some undesirable feature see end of Section 11.5  , below.On the other hand  , Model-Text provides the wikitravel page of the " Nashville " city in the state of Tennessee as the 1st suggestion in the ranking. For this context  , the Model- Anchor retrieves the disambiguation page of the wikitravel for Clarksville cities.This involves running the selected tool and then re-characterizing the output to both discover the technical characteristics of the new files created and to check that all the components are still present  , the relationships between them are intact and that the list of properties described above have indeed remained invariant. Once preservation planning has been completed  , the next step is then to carry out the migration.Next  , we discuss how the data types and queries are implemented in U-DBMS. All other existing data types and operators in the PostgreSQL system dotted-line boxes remain intact.The MESUR project was started in October of 2006 and thus  , is still in its early stages of development. A novel approach to data representation was defined that leverages both relational database and triple store technology.In Section 7.2 we discuss our results in contrast to other works that are not publicly available. In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.This definition is problematic because representation invariants are rarely expressed and even more rarely formalized in production software. Of course  , thread safety is not a precise concept: it is generally taken to mean that clients may only access a resource when the representation invariants of the resource are intact.It is difficult to compare its algorithm against existing ones due to the lack a standard performance metrics and the inherent difference in the nature of the data sets used for experimental analysis of different algorithms. Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.Figure 1plots the computed weight distribution for the MovieRating dataset given 100 training users. To better understand why our weighting scheme improves the performance of Pearson Correlation Coefficient method  , we first examine the distribution of weights for different movies.Besides  , we also plot the minimum bounding rectangles MBRs of tourist attractions for reference  , where the tourist attractions are collected from the metadata of OpenStreetMap. For the ease of presentation   , we highlight the clusters by different colors such that the size and shape of the clusters are clearly illustrated in the figures.Our primary purpose at this stage in our research is to check whether our basic hypothesis  , that words that tend to cohere spatially also tend to bear content  , is valid. Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results  , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.Unfortunately  , again  , the Ingenta ontology does not support expressing usage of scholarly documents  , which is a primary concern in MESUR. An interesting ontology-based approach was developed by the Ingenta MetaStore project 19.In the replaying stage  , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet. Our benchmark meets all the aforementioned requirements.50 test topics  , each consisting of title phrase  , description sentence  , and narrative paragraph fields  , were constructed using queries from commercial blog search engines e.g.  , BlogPulse and Technorati. Among the blog document set 100 ,649 feeds 38GB  , 2.8 million permalinks 75GB  , and 325 ,000 homepages 20GB  , only the permalinks were used in our experiment.Defining a model of the scholarly communication process represented as an RDF/OWL ontology 3. The MESUR project will proceed according to the following project phases: 1.For instance  , iRefIndex consists of 13 datasets BIND  , BioGRID  , CORUM  , DIP  , HPRD  , InnateDB  , IntAct  , MatrixDB  , MINT  , MPact  , MPIDB  , MPPI and OPHID while NCBO's Bioportal collection currently consists of 100 OBO ontologies including ChEBI  , Protein Ontology and the Gene Ontology. R2 also includes 3 datasets that are themselves aggregates of datasets which are now available as one resource.Thereafter  , we present the GERBIL framework. We begin by giving an overview of related work.In the context of sub-question 3  , we will perform various crowdsourcing tasks e.g. The " Open Knowledge Extraction " challenge at ESWC 7 and frameworks such as GERBIL 28 are good systems to validate our approach.The method penalizes mirrors and near mirrors   , whereas genuine agreement between the sources is kept intact. These experiments satisfy the two desiderata of collusion detection we discussed in Section 5.Also  , the casual users need not feel intimidated when adding annotations as there is no risk of altering the original document. The system can be inserted in many contexts  , including situations where the original files do not support annotations or must remain intact  , as in a digital preservation environment.For AIDA we downloaded the default entity repository that is suggested as reference for comparison. Spotlight and WAT are integrated in GERBIL by default  , whereas we manually downloaded Wikifier and AIDA and installed them on our server with its best settings.The MESUR reference data now consists of 1 billion individual usage events that were recorded at the documentlevel and processed as described above. Future analysis will focus on determining which request types most validly represent user interest.We located the words from the GeneRIF within the title and abstract. To determine the probability that a GeneRIF would be found in a particular position  , we annotated a set of 200 MedLine entries from LocusLink associated with GeneRIFs.On the other three collections  , the performance of all the three PRoc models is very close. In addition  , from Table 4 we observe that PRoc3 outperforms the other two on the WT2G collection.Interestingly  , this algorithm can be used effectively in certain scenarios of incremental classification.   , and queue need to be initialized  , leaving the background ontology O p and possibly its classification information R t   , S t intact.The MESUR project makes use of a triple store to represent and access its collected data. This design choice was a major factor that prompted the engineering of a new ontology for bibliographic and usage modeling.The AIDA annotator as well as the " Illinois Wikifier " will not be available in GERBIL since we restrict ourselves to webservices. 's initial work 7 in 2014  , GERBIL's community effort led to the implementation of overall 6 new annotators as well as the before mentioned generic NIF-based annotator.Here we consider the consumed items to be all latitude-longitude pairs of anonymized user check-ins. BrightKite was a location-based social networking website where users could check in to physical locations.In the following  , we present nine well-known and publicly available data sets which are integrated in GERBIL and are used in our evaluation. The reported results of our approach and competitive systems are based on this platform and serve as comparable results for future systems.OpenStreetMap. Our data is aggregated every 60 minutes  , comes from both TIM customers and roaming customers in the six cities  , and covers the time ranging from February to October 2014.market  , we used data provided by TripAdvisor: The consumers that write reviews about hotels on TripAdvisor also identify their travel purpose business  , romance  , family  , friend  , other  and age group 1317  , 18-24  , 25-34  , 35-49  , 50-64  , 65+. For our experimental evaluation  , we instantiated our model framework using as target application the area of hotel search.The LabelMe data set contains high-resolution photos  , in fact most of which are street view photos. From Figure 3   , it is easy to see that LabelMe and TinyImage have different characteristics.However  , these algorithms can be integrated at any time as soon as their webservices are available. The AIDA annotator as well as the " Illinois Wikifier " will not be available in GERBIL since we restrict ourselves to webservices.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications  , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites. In this paper  , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.We use the Gerbil testing platform 37 version 1.1.4 with the D2KB setting in which a document together with a fixed set of mentions to be annotated are given as input. Further   , we show an empirical comparison between PBoH and well known or recent competitive entity disambiguation systems .The relevance judgements were obtained from the LocusLink database 11. Basic biology includes isolation  , structure  , genetics and function of genes/proteins in normal and disease states 9.In both cases we used a target dimensionality o f d tar = 10 for the generalized nearest neighbor. The Spambase Database is derived from a collection of spam and non-spam e-mails and consists of 4601 instances with 57 numeric attributes.In the bottom half of Table 2we show rating statistics per Wikitravel category  , based on the estimated category per example. The ratings over the examples are distributed more evenly  , with the lowest rated example having an average rating of 1.41 and the highest 3.49.LabelMe is a web-based tool designed to facilitate image annotation. The first data set is 22K LabelMe used in 22  , 32.Instead  , there exists a publishing context that serves as an N-ary operator uniting a journal  , the article  , its publication date  , its authors  , and auxiliary information such as the source of the bibliographic data. For instance  , the MESUR ontology does not have a direct relationship between an article and its publishing journal.In fact  , by taking the OpenStreetMap polygons for Santa Barbara and Ventura and defining a regular point grid of 1 × 1 km  , we can compute the probability of grid points contained in Ventura to locate in the southeast of Santa Barbara grid points. This may be true for a certain point-feature representation of the cities but is not correct for all points inside the city boundaries.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic. The second and third requirements ruled out a uniform 2 % sample.Finally  , we discuss a pervasive pattern exhibited in all of our datasets: recency  , the tendency for more recently-consumed items to be reconsumed than items consumed further in the past. Recency is clearly present in MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE  , and absent from SHAKESPEARE and YES.Standard test collections are provided and metrics are defined for the evaluation of developed systems. To facilitate the development and advancement of video hyperlinking systems  , video hyperlinking has become a competition task since 2012 in MediaEval 6.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact. But the data on the other N-l discs is still available for reading and writing solving problem 2 above.Some bins had more  , some less  , than 500 documents  , due to the fact that messages were assigned to bins intact parent email together with all attachments  , making it impossible to see that every bin had exactly 500 documents. Once samples were drawn  , the messages in each sample were randomly divided into " bins " of approximately 500 documents each.We collected 250 attractions in Paris from the TripAdvisor website . The second dataset is used to generate the second feature representation described in Section 4.1.2.Early work kept the basic principles of the model intact   , while adding nesting Mos87  , BBG89  or exploiting commutativity properties of a general set of database operations as opposed to simply read and write Kor83  , BR92  , Weiss. A basic theme that runs through these three papers as well as others appearing around that time is the following: The consequences of rigid adherence to the ACID properties are too draconian for these then-new applications  , yet there is an appeal to the conceptual framework of the transaction abstraction that should not be entirely abandoned.This analysis indicates that the consumption of items strongly exhibit recency  , which we will model in Section 4.1. The behavior of caching for all the other datasets are in line with MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data  , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500. First  , we observe that the degree distributions are greatly affected by the existence of splogs.This is represented in Figure 5where an edge denotes a rdfs:subClassOf relationship. These MESUR classes are mesur:Agent  , mesur:Document  , and mesur:Context 7 .The dynamic of the OpenStreetMap project will ensure a steady growth of the dataset. This enhancement enables a variety of new Linked Data applications such as geo data syndication or semantic-spatial searches.In hearing about paper preservation " they think primarily in terms of mediaeval manuscripts  , precious editions and old documents. But unfortunately the users -the scientists and scholars -often underestimate the scope and the urgency of the need for preservation work.All subsequent links pass through the proxy server and are redirected to the vendor system with session connection information intact. Figure 2The short entry results are displayed to the user  , via a proxy server  , from the actual vendor system that was searched.For example  , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification. As a final remark  , although XVCL pushes the envelope further on unifying clones  , one should apply it only when the benefit is worth the effort.All figures are generated by our modified version of Java OpenStreetMap Editor 2 which is a map editor for OpenStreetMap 3 written in Java. The detail of our data preparation can be found in Section 6.In the Table 5  , we present lists of movies in two exemplary interest-groups learnt for the MovieRating dataset. The personalization term P m|u in the active-selection Equation 7 consists of two terms  , P z|u  , the user-group mixing probabilities and P m|z  , the probability of getting a rating for a movie m in group z.Furthermore  , the program prioritizes mutations based on their potential functional significance synonymous vs. non-synonymous substitutions as well as frequency. The presence of known SNPs derived by scanning dbSNP within each individual DNA are also noted on this viewer  , thus commonly occurring polymorphisms can be quickly eliminated from further analysis.29  proposed GERBIL - General Entity Annotator Benchmark  , an easy-to-use platform for the agile comparison of annotators using multiple data sets and uniform measuring approaches. To avoid this problem  , the authors of Uzbeck et al.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact . entity.In most cases  , significant increases in effectiveness are found for other popular projection functions including SH and SKLSH across both datasets Tables 1-2. We find that the superior retrieval effectiveness of GRH+NPQ is maintained when the hashcode length is varied between 16-128 bits for both LSH and PCA projections Figure 3a-b on CIFAR-10.The trees that remained intact during the last traversal are reused and the new aggregate values are added on. The two rightmost child trees are created again but now with the new values from the b1 subtree.Samples were composed following the allocation plan sketched above Section 2.1  , whereby strata are represented in the sample largely in accordance with their full-collection proportions. The operative unit for stratification was the message  , and messages were assigned intact parent email together with all attachments to strata.Since " Illinois Wikifier " is currently only available as local binary and GERBIL is solely based on webservices we excluded it from GER- BIL for the sake of comparability and server load. The authors provide their datasets 9 as well as their software " Illinois Wikifier " 10 online.Consequently the original datasets were left intact.  Subjects' authoring and design experiences were mostly scaled little or average  , with a low difference between skill levels.This trend is an important ground for the effectiveness of MMPD. For different n and d  , the upper bound and lower bound differs from each other; however  , the trend remains intact.Another significant component of the MESUR project is the development of a scholarly ontology that represents bibliographic  , citation  , usage concepts  , along with concepts for expressing different artifact metrics. The project includes efforts to define provenance XML schemas  , algorithms for uncertainty quantification  , and a novel semantic query model that leverages both relational and triple store databases.Linked- GeoData is derived from OpenStreetMap and OpenStreetMap is an open  , collaborative bottom-up effort for collecting this large-scale spatial knowledge base. The assumptions we make on the considered dataset are as follows.In the LocusLink lexicon  , entries are indexed by acronyms  , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms. In the AcroMed lexicon  , entries are indexed by technical terms or phrases  , and each entry is a list of acronyms associated with the corresponding technical term/phrase  , accompanied by the frequencies of such associations.Ratings are implemented with a slider  , so Jester's scale is continuous. Jester has a rating scale from -10 to 10.RDF 15 triple databases are the natural habitat for data represented in this manner  , and they provide great flexibility for data analysis without the need for extensive upfront application design. This ontology forms the basis for the representation of the reference data set in the MESUR infrastructure.Example. In this way  , the global schema remains intact.This includes bibliographic data such as author  , title  , identifier  , publication date and usage data such as the IP address of the accessing agent  , the date and time of access  , type of usage  , etc. The proposed MESUR ontology is practical  , as opposed to all encompassing  , in that it represents those artifacts and properties that  , as previously shown in 4  , are realistically available from modern scholarly information systems.We have not addressed the possibility that the user's subject context is excluded from the display. The two methods described in this section focus the user's display on their current context e.g.  , mediaeval history.It was expected that teachers with lower experience would be less likely to customize. Hypothesis 2 was posed to provide understanding of whether teachers' varying level of teaching experience influenced the desire to customize materials versus download them intact.were detailed earlier in this document. Figure 3below shows the precision at 5 -1000 documents returned from running the modified queries on WT2g.Researching sampling bias: MESUR examines the effects of sampling biases on its reference data set to determine whether and how a usage data set can be compiled that is representative of global scholarly us- age. 2.The criteria for relevance in the context of CTIR are not obvious. NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.For each tags query second column  , the top several retrieved images are shown in the fourth column. Table 4: Retrieval examples by tags queries on the LabelMe database by the proposed method.For Jester  , which had a high density of available ratings  , the model was a 300-fold compression. In other words  , the model was a 10-fold compression of the original data.This ontology forms the basis for the representation of the reference data set in the MESUR infrastructure. The requirement to handle a variety of semantic relationships publishes  , cites  , uses and different types of content bibliographic data  , citation data  , usage data  , led MESUR to define a context-centric OWL ontology that models the scholarly communication process 19 3 .With GERBIL  , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks. In this paper  , we presented and evaluated GERBIL  , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks.If the content remains unchanged  , the hashes will still match at the root. If the structure remains intact  , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.To assign the examples to the categories  , we crawled all 50 example websites  , downloading the homepage from each example  , and following site-internal links up to one level deep. Therefore   , we use the descriptions from the 50 examples and the 21 ,872 Wikitravel suggestions to assign the 50 examples to the 5 Wikitravel categories.Following conventional treatment  , we also augmented each feature vector by a constant term 1. For article features  , we normalized URL and Editor categories together  , and kept the CTR term a real value intact .They do not realize that the danger of getting lost concerns a substantial part of the comparatively recent written record. In hearing about paper preservation " they think primarily in terms of mediaeval manuscripts  , precious editions and old documents.We choose the top 20 hotels in Amish Country  , Lancaster County  , PA from Hotels.com and TripAdvisor. Case study: Finding hotels in Amish Country.Issuing the generated queries based on the top 30 keywords per site resulted in a ranked list of the 5 candidate categories for each given example website. The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations  , which we indexed using Indri.Moreover  , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL. This result in itself is of high practical significance as it means that by using GERBIL  , developers can evaluate on currently 11 datasets using the same effort they needed for 1  , which is a gain of more than 1100%.Note that in all the results reported  , mentions that contain NIL or empty ground truth entities are discarded before the evaluation; this decision is taken as well in Gerbil version 1.1.4. Let M * be the ground truth entity annotations associated with a given set of mentions X.We find that the superior retrieval effectiveness of GRH+NPQ is maintained when the hashcode length is varied between 16-128 bits for both LSH and PCA projections Figure 3a-b on CIFAR-10. Each of these increases are found to be statistically significant using a Wilcoxon signed rank test p-value < 0.01.Reductions help find syntactically simpler forms of an expression while keeping its semantics intact. A particularly inspiring feature of the AQL optimizer is that it has the powerful capability of optimizing operators or newly added functions on the calculus level  , i.e.  , by application of variations of λ-calculus reductions over the operators definitions.For getting the informative words  , i.e.  , function words and introducers in this paper  , from training data  , we gather GeneRIF from LocusLink. The overall architecture of the extraction from Medline to candidate GeneRIF is shown in Figure 2.A second difference concerns the objectives of the search procedures operating in the system. The sources of the stored documentation are thus very varied ; in the case of the existing prototype mediaeval history of France the sources include : original documents  , learned contemporary works  , articles from journals  , etc.Being a web-based platform it can be also used to publish the disambiguation results. 29  proposed GERBIL - General Entity Annotator Benchmark  , an easy-to-use platform for the agile comparison of annotators using multiple data sets and uniform measuring approaches.In the case of SRAA dataset we inferred 8 topics on the training data and labeled these 8 topics for all the three classification tasks discussed above. For various subsets of the datasets discussed above  , we choose number of topics as twice the number of classes.Figure 4 is the high-level pseudo code of our algorithm. We opt for leaving the fully utilized instances intact as they already make good contributions.Although other approaches to identifier splitting have used a dictionary to further split identifier words with no boundaries 15  , 24  , such as " scrollbar " or " textfield  , " in this work we have conservatively chosen to leave such words intact. Body statements present additional challenges in determining appropriate direct and indirect objects.In GERBIL  , we make use of the D2KB task  , which evaluates entity disambiguation only. To evaluate DoSeR as well as the competitive disambiguation systems we use the GERBIL -General Entity Annotator Benchmark 23  which offers an easy-touse platform for the agile comparison of annotators using multiple data sets.Table 2summarizes the most popular point-of-interest annotations currently found in the OpenStreetMap data. As a result  , we obtained 192 million pointsof-interest   , which are annotated with roughly 800 million property-value combinations.  , and queue need to be initialized  , leaving the background ontology O p and possibly its classification information R t   , S t intact. To be precise  , we simply dump the values ofThe breakdown of usage data sources is as follows 2 : Publishers Six major international scholarly publishers. So far  , MESUR reached agreements for the exchange of usage data with 14 parties  , and as a result has compiled a data set covering over 1 billion article-level usage events  , as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data.From the source data  , we generated two datasets for question identification. 1 We obtained 1 ,212 ,153 threads from TripAdvisor forum 6 ; 2 We obtained 86 ,772 threads from LonelyPlanet forum 7 ; 3 We obtained 25 ,298 threads from BootsnAll Network 8 .He has severe hearing loss  , but is otherwise nonfocal. His visual fields are intact.They concluded that linkage in WT2g was inadequate for web experiments. Singhal and Kaszkiel 4 looked at average in-and out-links  , within and across hosts  , between the smaller WT2g corpus and their own large crawl.Currently  , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features  , capabilities and experiments. Furthermore  , we were not able to find a running webservice or source code for this approach.But no explicit social relationships are maintained in TripAdvisor   , so we need to construct an implicit influence network and learn the influence probabilities on the network. In the formulation of the participation maximization problem Section 4  , the social influence network is treated as an input of the problem.Hence  , while keeping the implementation effort previously required to evaluate on a single dataset  , we allow developers to evaluate on currently  11 times more datasets. The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work.While AGDISTIS has been in the source code of the BAT-Framework provided by a third-party after publication of Cornolti et al. Table 1compares the implemented annotation systems of GERBIL and the BAT-Framework.Citation data are routinely used to assess the impact of journals  , journal articles  , scholarly authors  , and the institutions these authors are affiliated with. Creating a reference data set: MESUR has invested significant energy to compile a large-scale col- 1 Pronounced " measure "   , an acronym for " Metrics from Scholarly Usage of Resources " .The Spambase Database is derived from a collection of spam and non-spam e-mails and consists of 4601 instances with 57 numeric attributes. The Ionosphere Database consists of 351 instances with 34 numeric attributes and contains 2 classes  , which come from a classiication of radar returns from the ionosphere .While the triple store is still a maturing technology  , it provides many advantages over the relational database model. The MESUR project makes use of a triple store to represent and access its collected data.Due to the community effort behind GERBIL  , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9. Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework  , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.The truth is  , although there are many unwanted terms in the expanded query model from feedback documents  , there are also more relevant terms than what the user can possibly select from the list of presentation terms generated with pseudo-feedback documents  , and the positive effects often outweights the negative ones. Actually  , when we use the truncated query model instead of the intact one refined from relevance feedback  , the MAP is only 0.304.The MESUR ontology provides three subclasses of owl:Thing. The most general class in OWL is owl:Thing.In order to publish the OpenStreetMap data  , we performed some preprocessing of the data structures. Overall  , the project had produced a 160GB database of geo data until July 2008  , in some regions surpassing commercial geo data providers in terms of precision and detail.For recommender systems which present ranked lists of items to the user  , We computed the average error for Jester 2.0 algorithm across the It is difficult to compare its algorithm against existing ones due to the lack a standard performance metrics and the inherent difference in the nature of the data sets used for experimental analysis of different algorithms.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise. We also assume a trusted and independent audit log validation service which  , given access to a copy of the database  , will verify the validity of the audit log.Perhaps because of the density  , and/or because the continuous scale introduces less quantization error in ratings  , Jester exhibits lower NMAE values than the other datasets we tested. Ratings are implemented with a slider  , so Jester's scale is continuous.In certain cases  , the usage data is provided by the source in an anonymized form  , in other cases MESUR is responsible for the required processing. As a result  , all usage data in the MESUR reference data set is anonymized both regarding individual and institutional identity.The new terms are processed and added to the display  , leaving the earlier portion of the query display intact. The user can also add new terms to an existing query by appending them to the original natural language query string.Singhal and Kaszkiel 4 looked at average in-and out-links  , within and across hosts  , between the smaller WT2g corpus and their own large crawl. To answer that  , we first need to understand more about what the web looks like.Program states will be kept intact across web interactions; 4. Values obtained from web input will be well typed; 3.After excluding splogs from the BlogPulse data  , we 14 for the BlogPulse dataset  , we replicate the result that the cumulative in-degree and out-degree distributions show smoother curves  , as shown in Figure 3.To complete this annotating procedure  , we have to deal with the first stage automatically since the coverage of GeneRIF records in LocusLink depends on human experts and it cannot come up with the speedy growth of the literatures. This figure shows the feasibility of maintaining the knowledge bases and ontology using natural language processing technology.Therefore  , uncertainty quantification is important to MESUR as it will help to assess the reliability of results obtained from mining the reference data set. It should be noted that both the filtering and de-duplication sub-tasks are inherently statistical procedures  , and that the achieved success rates influence the quality of the reference data set.On the contrary  , the images in TinyImage data set have low-resolution. The LabelMe data set contains high-resolution photos  , in fact most of which are street view photos.This results in irregular shapes for the cumulative degree distributions  , which represent the proportion of blogs having at least k in-links or out-links. Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data  , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.LQ12 designed a spider framework to crawl websites from tripadvisor  , in order to collect candidate pages related to attractions  , restaurants etc. The similarities are computed based on the either the category or description of the suggestions.4 In Figure 7 we have already illustrated the distribution of ratings over time for the hotel Punta Cana Princess evaluated on TripAdvisor. However  , reviews shortly after the second anomaly note that " .. they are now doing some construction to try and fix things .. "   , giving hint to an improvement of the airport which may have caused the better evaluation almost no 1 star ratings at the end of the rating behavior.Figure 3below shows the precision at 5 -1000 documents returned from running the modified queries on WT2g. We hope that the 10GB dataset next year will contain a higher percentage of Functional links.This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted  , left intact or deleted. There are two constraints on S. The first states that ∀xi P y j ∈T ∪{λ} Syj|xi = 1.Records may be physically deleted immediately when a delete command is received or they may be flagged as deleted but left intact until garbage collection is done. Of concern is the method by which records are deleted.Generating maps of science: MESUR produces maps of science on the basis of its reference data set. 3.However  , accurate estimation of visit probabilities is impossibile due to the lack of login and browsing data of TripAdvisor users. Meanwhile   , we want to obtain a visit probability sequence that is similar at least in trend to the real data.Results of the experiments run on the Gerbil platform are shown in Table 2. All these methods are tested in the setting where a fixed set of mentions is given as input  , without requiring the mention detection step.This behavior is particularly strong for the BRIGHTKITE dataset  , where cyclic behavior has been observed 10. Finally   , we observe that the time scores capture cyclic behavior in the check-in data around daily and weekly marks.The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work. Moreover  , 6 novel annotators were added to the platform.So parity striping has better fault containment than RAIDS designs. In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.Generating all recommendations for one user took 7 milliseconds on the same hardware as the previous experiment. For the Jester dataset with 100 items  , 9000 users and k = 14  , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications. To the best of our knowledge  , there exists no previous benchmark which can automatically emulate the process of user Web surfing in a way fair to Web browsers.This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions. The output of this technique RunA is compared with using KNN instead of the Softmax algorithm RunB.22K LabelMe contains 22 ,019 images sampled from the large LabelMe data set. Most images in LabelMe contain multiple objects.UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink. LocusLink is used to find the aliases of the acronyms identified by AcroMed.Its responsiveness performance is closer to users' perception than any of other benchmarks. Since the Web content  , user interactions  , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers  , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers.NIST assessors referred to the WT2g collection during the process of ad hoc topic generation. Naturally  , there may be considerable variation from one topic to another.7 The MESUR website offers detailed information on metric definitions and abbreviations: http://www.mesur.org/ With the addition of the Thomson Scientific journal Impact Factor a set of 47 metrics of scholarly impact result.dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs  , selected using Locuslink information. Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents  , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data. The Disk1&2  , Disk4&5 collection contains newswire articles from various sources  , such as Association Press AP  , Wall Street Journal WSJ  , Financial Times FT  , etc.  , which are usually considered as high-quality text data with little noise.Those are mutually exclusive with testing data in Genome Task and our testing data. For getting the informative words  , i.e.  , function words and introducers in this paper  , from training data  , we gather GeneRIF from LocusLink.Furthermore  , according to global OpenStreetMap statistics 1   , Italy and UK are ranked 7th and 10th for number of created spatial objects  , and 4th and 5th for density of created spatial objects per square kilometer. Since we decided to focus on Milano and London  , however  , we can discard this potential issue: our direct knowledge of the city of Milano let us affirm that the spatial objects mapping is quite good and homogeneous throughout the city; OpenStreetMap coverage in the London area was evaluated in 18 and shown to be quite accurate in comparison to official sources.The results strongly point towards the imminent feasibility of usage-based metrics of impact. This paper has described preliminary results derived from an analysis of a subset of the MESUR reference data set that consists of over 200 million article-level usage events.The dataset integration and data preparation is done in two steps. We use similar configuration to index the Wikitravel dataset.26 To this end  , GERBIL implements a Java-based NIF 15 reader and writer module which enables loading arbitrary NIF document collections  , as well as the communication to NIF-based webservices. Moreover  , we capitalize upon the uptake of publicly available  , NIF based corpora over the last years 40  , 36.The item consumed in this case is the check-in location given by its anonymized identity and geographical coordinates. BrightKite is a now defunct location-based social networking website www.brightkite.com where users could publicly check-in to various locations.We randomly sample a subset of CIFAR-10 with 5000 points for evaluation. To get a deeper comparison  , we perform another experiment on smaller datasets where the full supervised information can be used for training.Figure 6 presents the complete taxonomy of the MESUR ontology. No holonymy/meronymy composite class definitions are used at this stage of the ontology's development. Journal-level usage events: All article-level usage events were converted to journal-level usage events to facilitate the interpretation and cross-validation of initial results. The preliminary results discussed in the following sections were generated on the basis of an early subset of the MESUR data set that was selected to offer the best possible outcomes at the time:  200 million article-level usage events: A subset consisting of the most thoroughly validated and deduplicated usage events.Then  , the allocations produced by the policy are identical for corresponding facts in D and D . Let D be any database and let D be obtained from D by possibly modifying the measure attribute values in each fact r arbitrarily but keeping the dimension attribute values in r intact.More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website. In comparison to earlier frameworks  , it extends the stateof-the-art benchmarks by the capability of considering the influence of NIL attributes and the ability of dealing with data sets and annotators that link to different knowledge bases.We also use different algorithms for cost evaluation of orders. The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.An  list  , and leave the original node intact except changing its timestamp . Information for this result can be found in 8.Session identifiers  , anonymized user identifiers  , anyonymized IP addresses  , and event timestamps are information elements that are at the core of this process. Since MESUR follows an approach of usage data analysis inspired by clickstream concepts 12  , 11 grouping events is an essential processing sub-task that needs to be performed before ingesting the usage data into the reference data set.Second  , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality  , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system  , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user‐spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest  , it embodies the  Rest of the spots sorting First of all  , we sort the probability of user interest of dislike for each category in ascending way. First of all  , the recommended spots should conform to the requirements of location in context  , so we will use location as a criterion of the recommendation system.The application of opinion modules is similar to on-topic retrieval optimization in that opinion scores generated by modules act as opinion reranking factors to boost the ranks of opinionated blogs in the topic-reranked results. We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.Next to individual configurable experiments  , GERBIL offers an overview of recent experiment results belonging to the same experiment and matching type in the form of a Table 5: Results of an example experiment. Offering such detailed and structured experimental results opens new research avenues in terms of tool and dataset diagnostics to increase decision makers' ability to choose the right settings for the right use case.GERBIL is an opensource and extensible framework that allows evaluating tools against currently 9 different annotators on 11 different datasets within 6 different experiment types. In this paper  , we present GERBIL – a general entity annotator benchmark –  , a community-driven effort to enable the continuous evaluation of annotation tools.From the sources we employed for knowledge-based query expansion  , the AcroMed database of biomedical acronyms produced expansions of highest quality   , outperforming both the euGenes and LocusLink genetic databases. We have shown that most of the techniques utilized by our system improved recall and precision.As a result  , all usage data in the MESUR reference data set is anonymized both regarding individual and institutional identity. Most agreements thus contain explicit statements with this regard.The CIFAR-10 dataset 11 consists of 60 ,000 color images drawn from the 80M tiny image collection 29. We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 11  and NUS- WIDE 3.We can observe that the PLM improves performance on WT2G and FR clearly and consistently  , which shows that  , similar to general passage retrieval  , the PLM can bring added benefits to document retrieval when documents are relatively long. The results are shown in Figure 4  , where we vary the smoothing parameters for both smoothing methods on all the four data sets.This assumption seems to be confirmed by the pattern that emerges as the MESUR reference data set grows and becomes more diverse over time. As a result  , one can assume that substantial usage data sets must be aggregated from a variety of sources in order to derive conclusions that have global reach 3 .In Jester  , users rate a core set of jokes  , and then receive recommendations about others that they should like. The Jester dataset comes from Ken Goldberg's joke recommendation website  , Jester 10.It is surprising that adding gene information from euGenes and LocusLink deteriorates the mean average precision comparing rows Heuristics&AcroMed and All of the above in Table  3   , although the additional data increases the recall from 5 ,284 to 5 ,315 relevant documents. The second best contributor is the AcroMed acronym database  , which causes an improvement of 4.8% over the Heuristics only run.Each image of size 32 × 32 is represented by a 512-dimensional GIST feature vector. The CIFAR-10 dataset 11 consists of 60 ,000 color images drawn from the 80M tiny image collection 29.We filter out those points which are either outside of the city boundary or in the ocean. In fact  , by taking the OpenStreetMap polygons for Santa Barbara and Ventura and defining a regular point grid of 1 × 1 km  , we can compute the probability of grid points contained in Ventura to locate in the southeast of Santa Barbara grid points.The publication of the OpenStreetMap data using Triplify adds a completely new dimension to the Data Web: spatial data can be retrieved and interlinked on an unprecedented level of granularity. Performance results for retrieving points-of-interest in different areas are summarized in Table 3.The out-links file consisted of  , for each document d  , the document numbers of the documents d links to. Accordingly  , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.After filtering out locations not appearing in our corpus  , we built a location set consisting of 36 locations  , based on which pair-wise location similarities were computed as describe in Section 2.4.1 to form a location similarity graph. We first collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor 8 for four travel intentions including Beaches & Sun  , Casinos  , History & Culture  , and Skiing.Per geographic context the ranked suggestions are filtered on location. We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.For instance  , the most popular of these services  , Wikia 2   , has more than three thousand collections  , some of them with more than fifty thousand documents. These services host large numbers of collections  , focused on subjects as diverse as geographical information  , sports  , technology   , science  , TV shows  , fiction  , events  , and books  , to cite only a few.The requirement is incorrect and the Sender is not convinced that it is correct he feels that something is wrong. However  , an intact partnership between Sender and Receiver would provide an open communication between them and prevent information hiding.The system can be inserted in many contexts  , including situations where the original files do not support annotations or must remain intact  , as in a digital preservation environment. These features don't require modification of the original documents or impose further restrictions  , and thus can be adopted without any additional infrastructures.We used a version of the LocusLink database containing 128 ,580 entries. It provides detailed information about the function and position of genes.In the scholarly community  , while articles  , journals  , conference proceedings  , and the like are well documented and represented in formats that lend themselves to analysis  , other information  , such as usage data  , tends to be less explicit due to the inherent privacy issues surrounding individual usage behavior. Thus  , the MESUR ontology is constrained to bibliographic and usage data since these are the primary sources of scholarly data.Usage instructions and further information can be also found at http://LinkedGeoData.org. The dynamic of the OpenStreetMap project will ensure a steady growth of the dataset.MEDLINE abstract GeneRIF GO annotation GO:0005515 term: protein binding definition: Interacting selectively with any protein  , or protein complex a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules. To complete this annotating procedure  , we have to deal with the first stage automatically since the coverage of GeneRIF records in LocusLink depends on human experts and it cannot come up with the speedy growth of the literatures.For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets  , we randomly sample 1 ,000 points as query set  , 1 ,000 points as validation set  , and all the remaining points as training set. All our experiments are conducted on a workstation with 24 Intel Xeon CPU cores and 64 GB RAM.GERBIL can be used with systems and datasets from any domain. compared more than 15 systems on 20 different datasets.It is easy to see that after any update  , the invariant that no trees overlap in the time dimension is preserved. Otherwise  , we leave the trees intact.There are a number of future directions for this work. 4 Validation on new data sets  , such as the Jester data set 7 in progress.The WT2g connectivity data see http://pastime.anu.edu.au/WAR/WT2g_Links/ilink_WTonly.gz and the Small Web qrels file were used to find the set of documents which link directly to relevant documents. ACSys has attempted to determine whether this was the case by looking at the indirectly relevant documents retrieved by the runs listed in Table 7.To ensure the practicability and convenience of the GER- BIL framework  , we investigated the effort needed to use GERBIL for the evaluation of novel annotators. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 4.We collected the MEDLINE references as described before  , LocusLink has a set of references to MED- LINE documents relevant to the gene for documents corresponding to each organism in LocusLink. We used the combined information in LocusLink and MEDLINE to identify the descriptors used to characterize the organisms for MEDLINE documents.The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact. Moreover the system can easily be extended to support other data sources only by adding support for the protocol used to communicate with the source.Tables showing  , for each topic  , the stratum-by-stratum partitioning of the collection  , the samples drawn from each stratum  , and the pre-and post-adjudication assessments attached to those samples are provided in an appendix to this document Appendix A. The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message  , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.First-time and secondtime reviewers excluded. c TripAdvisor.Moreover  , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded  , so they are intact. All other buffer pool pages are preserved.Descriptions from positive examples in the user profiles are used as queries to rank suggestions. This systems extracts suggestions for sightseeing  , shopping  , eating  , and drinking from Wikitravel pages dedicated to US cities.This storage remains intact and available across system failures. The nonvolatile version of the log is stored on what is generally called stable storage e.g.  , disk.These criteria  , also known as significant properties  , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention. Again  , these evaluations will be performed according to multiple criteria.For each query  , the lexicons are applied in the order of AcroMed  , LocusLink  , and UMLS for query expansion. The entry provided by UMLS for the phrase " mad cow disease " is " bovine spongiform encephalopathy  , bse  , bovine spongiform encephalitis "   , excluding the variants generated by varying the form or order of the words.1 We obtained 1 ,212 ,153 threads from TripAdvisor forum 6 ; 2 We obtained 86 ,772 threads from LonelyPlanet forum 7 ; 3 We obtained 25 ,298 threads from BootsnAll Network 8 . We selected three forums of different scales to obtain source data.We also find statistically significant gains in performance on the larger CIFAR-10 and 100k TinyImages datasets. This result is statistically significant based upon a paired t-test across 10 random training/testing partitions of the dataset p-value: ≤ 1.7 × 10 −5 .The classic Rocchio's model  , fails to obtain improvement on the WT2G collection. The effectiveness of pseudo relevance feedback is reconfirmed in this set of experiments.Even though some of these instances might not be required for running some of our applications  , they represent an important and resourceful part of the KB and can be considered as a type of ontology use  , and hence it was deemed important to make sure that all these instances remain intact. Figure 1gives some idea on how sparsely instantiated the AKTRO is in our repository.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 . OpenStreetMap OSM maintains a global editable map that depends on users to provide the information needed for its improvement and evolution.For instance  , the MESUR ontology does not have a direct relationship between an article and its publishing journal. OntologyX uses context classes as the " glue " for relating other classes  , an approach that was adopted for the MESUR ontology.We then present an evaluation of the framework that aims to quantify the effort necessary to include novel annotators and datasets to the framework. We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs. Opinion modules require opinion lexicons  , which are extracted from training data.All experimental results are averaged over 10 independent rounds of random training / validation / query partitions. Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6  , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.If a failure  , disaster or intentional attack affects the metadata catalog  , it can cause a total data loss  , even if the data stored on the other nodes remain intact. This metadata catalog is supported by a centralized database system  , which represents a point of failure when used in the context of a preservation scenario.All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site. These browsers cover the most wellknown layout engines  , such as Trident and Gecko  , as well as several widely used JavaScript engines.If users are satiating on items  , we expect to see some k for which the probability of continuing runs decreases as the run length Figure 5: Lack of satiation in MAPCLICKS  , BRIGHTKITE  , and GPLUS. In Figure 5  , we show this curve for several of our datasets.The undecidability remains intact in the absence of attributes with a finite domain. The undecidability can be verified by reduction from the implication problem for standard FDs and INDs.The validity of what remains from that execution is now in serious doubt  , since originally transactions read data items updated by T and acted accordingly  , whereas now T's operations have vanished but its indirect impact on its dependent transactions is still apparent. Given a concurrent execution of a set of transactions i.e.  , an interleaved sequence of operations compensation for one of the transactions  , T  , can be modeled as an attempt to cancel the operations of T while leaving the rest of the sequence intact.We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts. Thus  , we aimed at augmenting folksonomy-style tagging by more standard ways of assigning metadata.Therefore  , the MESUR project uses a combination of a relational database to store and query item e.g. However  , their scalability and retrieval efficiency are generally not on a par with the most competitive relational database products .Using various data sources of substantial size gives the opportunity to find intended POIs  , which may fall into multiple concepts ranging from rather generic to more detailed ones such as " restaurant " vs. " pizzeria. " First  , for a meaningful search result  , we need to consider data obtained by integrating multiple data sources  , which may be provided by autonomous vendors in heterogeneous formats e.g.  , OpenStreetMap or Open Government Data data  , a restaurant guide  , etc.There were two t ypes of content-and-link runs used; a very simple sibling relationship implementation  , and another version that aimed to overcome some of the simpler run's short- comings. Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.The Do and Drink categories are the least liked while the Eat category is the highest rated. In the bottom half of Table 2we show rating statistics per Wikitravel category  , based on the estimated category per example.Since RS is written only by the tuple mover  , we expect it will typically escape damage. The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.As illustrated in Figure 3  , a similar pattern is observed for the evaluation by the TBG metric. However  , the Clarksville is not mentioned in the anchor text of the Nashville wikitravel page  , and it is reasonable that it is not included in the top-5 ranking of the Model-Anchor.To check this  , we used the pdftotext utility  , which extracts into plain UTF-8. One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.However  , creating and maintaining the knowledge bases requires enormous work. In the past  , researchers in biomedicine have already constructed large scale of databases such as UMLS 1  , Gene Ontology 2  , SwissProt 3  , GenBank 4  , DIP 5  , SNOMED 6  , and LocusLink 7 etc.  , which are useful for researches to capture and organize information.The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13 ,456 different genes grouped into 3 ,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies. For example  , the gene olfactory receptor  , family 5  , subfamily V  , member 1 is a member of subfamily V of the olfactory receptor family.This is also known as soft thresholding and its application to the wavelet representation is known as wavelet shrinkage. perform thresholding is to shrink each retained coefficient towards zero  , rather than keeping them intact.A sentence classifier was built using GeneRIF entries in LocusLink excluding those that were in the secondary .txt file and their abstracts. Each abstract sentence was classified to gauge its likelihood as a source of a GeneRIF.Analysis of the training queries and their corresponding qrel documents showed other discrepencies within gene symbols. Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink.discussing travel experiences in TripAdvisor. Answers while others could be more general e.g.In addition  , 100% of the records were almost instantaneously mirrored on a subscribing news server  " beaufort " . 100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server  , " beatitude. "BrightKite was a location-based social networking website where users could check in to physical locations. BRIGHTKITE.perform thresholding is to shrink each retained coefficient towards zero  , rather than keeping them intact. Additionally  , the best way to Figure 2: Illustration of intuition  , via two simple  , extreme examples: a1–3 perturbation most resilient to any true value leaks  , and b1–3 most resilient to any linear filtering.BrightKite is a now defunct location-based social networking website www.brightkite.com where users could publicly check-in to various locations. BRIGHTKITE.In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL. link to a KB task.Thus both clusters are left intact. The cluster .3 ,.3 ,.2 pulls the mean up but the cluster .1 ,.05 ,.05 pulls it down somewhat and thus the partition point occurs between the two clusters.Table 3 shows the various statistics about the datasets. The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP  , http: //snap.stanford.edu.Session-based grouping: Usage data is typically recorded and hence provided to MESUR as a time-sequential list of individual events recorded by an information system; different events generated by the same agent in the course of a certain time span are not grouped. 4.This is a semantic and applicationdependent decision. In general   , however  , the algorithm should not make a choice of which trees to prune and which to keep intact.After code is checked in for the first time  , subsequent 'check-in's need to store only the changes from last checkin . Nevertheless  , the identity of program entities remains intact even after refactoring operations.However  , it was more convenient for us to download the most up-todate original OpenStreetMap data about Bremen  , available as Shapefiles 10 . OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .As for our method  , CI is always = 0 since we use runtime adaptation hence the UI representation e.g.  , HTML pages will remain completely intact at design-time. The research work that used AOP for adapting the UI's behavior 9 Section 2.2 relied on manually creating multiple adapted UI layouts hence we also consider its v value to be > 1.Since we decided to focus on Milano and London  , however  , we can discard this potential issue: our direct knowledge of the city of Milano let us affirm that the spatial objects mapping is quite good and homogeneous throughout the city; OpenStreetMap coverage in the London area was evaluated in 18 and shown to be quite accurate in comparison to official sources. Still  , the mapping can be inhomogeneous some zones can be more detailed annotated than others.We find that both algorithms are powerful for improving retrieval performance in biomedical domain. Algorithm 2 needs to use AcroMed and LocusLink databases for query expansion.In Table 5 we report the percentage of mean average precision achieved by each bilingual run performed with intact translation resources when pre-translation expansion was not used. A baseline of English monolingual performance is shown in Table  4  , for the three query forms title-only or T  , title+description or TD  , and title+description+narrative or TDN with and without the application of pseudo relevance feedback.The key ingredient in applications for which the ACID properties are too strict is interaction. Early work kept the basic principles of the model intact   , while adding nesting Mos87  , BBG89  or exploiting commutativity properties of a general set of database operations as opposed to simply read and write Kor83  , BR92  , Weiss.The automated and generic nature of our instrumentation makes our approach transparent and helps developers keep their original source code intact. Moreover  , persistence is a cross-cutting concern   , so scattered changes are need over the application's code  , making it less maintainable.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil. We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work.To facilitate the development and advancement of video hyperlinking systems  , video hyperlinking has become a competition task since 2012 in MediaEval 6. Therefore  , video hyperlinking enables users to navigate between video segments in a large video collection 3.It is our understanding that any implementation of these approaches would not succeed in improving precision to any usable extent  , if at all when the experiments were based on the WT2g dataset  , due to the lack of Functional links. We didn't implement any of these approaches  , as we felt that more was to be gained from developing our own ideas  , with the knowledge that the other methods existed.For those objects left unexamined  , we have only a statistical assurance that the information is intact. 4.We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work. We then present an evaluation of the framework that aims to quantify the effort necessary to include novel annotators and datasets to the framework.One system also ignores individual user preferences  , while the other tries to take those preferences into account when ranking suggestions. We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.For this context  , the Model- Anchor retrieves the disambiguation page of the wikitravel for Clarksville cities. As a matter of fact  , there are based on the only anchor text of the pages in the tiny aggregators sub collection.
