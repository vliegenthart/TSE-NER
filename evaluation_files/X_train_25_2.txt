their ground truth difference with the production ranker would be the same as ordering them by the estimated difference. P -perfect user model setting  , I -informational  , N -navigational LETOR eval- uation.We test our model on two subtasks from Semeval-2015 Task 10: phrase-level subtask A and message-level subtask B 1 . For the phrase-level subtask the size of the word type embeddings  , which encode tokens that span the target phrase or not  , is set to 10.In LETOR 3.0 package  , each dataset is partitioned into five for five-fold cross validation and each fold includes training   , testing and validation sets. Table 1shows the statistics of the datasets included in the LETOR 3.0 benchmark.To create features for the selection framework  , we use the published test runs 1 for these rankers to obtain the document scores for top 10 ranking documents  , and the list of 64 features that are available as part of LETOR. We use the results from three ranker baselines: Rank- Boost 5  , Regression  , and FRank 9 .all the incoming and outgoing links  , and for different values of the parameter λ  , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus Savoy 01. Fixing the parameter λ to 0.1 and k to 5  , the final retrieval status value of D 4   , noted RSVD 4   , will be :Low-level features include term frequency tf  , inverse document frequency idf  , document length dl  , and their combinations. Features in Letor OHSUMED dataset consists of 'low-level' features and 'high-level' features.On the Microsoft LETOR data set  , we see a small decrease in accuracy  , but the speedups are even more impressive. In particular  , on Set 1 the larger data set  , our parallel algorithm  , within a matter of hours  , achieves Expected Reciprocal Rank results that are within 1.4% of the best known results 6.To examine as many different implementations and hosts as possible  , we noted that the Billion Triple Challenge 2014 13 dataset consisted of a 4 GTriple corpus of spidered Web data. This resulted in a list of 312 endpoints.We compare the following three methods using Douban datasets: 1. This setting is employed to fairly compare the method SRimp with SRexp.The experimental results show that our approach can improve the base algorithm significantly with better precision  , recall and conversion rates. We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.Spreadsheets collected in our case study are those used in practice and maintained by professional finance officers. We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.Finally  , we evaluate the proposed method on LETOR 3.0 benchmark collections1. The empirical results indicate that even with sparse models  , the ranking performance is still comparable to that of the standard gradient descent ranking algorithm.The dictionary we are using in our research  , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE Proctor 781  , has the following information associated with its senses: part of speech  , subcategorizationl   , morphology  , semantic restrictions   , and subject classification. What's important for our purposes is that the senses have information associated with them that will help us to distinguish them.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset  , consisting of 247 ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements. In order to test whether the associated hypothesis is true  , we developed a software application which would produce results based on conventional Content Analysis the baseline result and then re-rank those results based on a number of related Connectivity Analysis approaches.From the remaining 306 topics  , we selected 75 topics as follows. We started from the 506 topics gathered for FedWeb 2013 5  , leaving out the 200 topics provided to the FedWeb 2013 participants.use  , it is designed at a level of generality that does not directly support the granularity required by the MESUR project. author  , and action e.g.They learn multiple ranking models for each of these clusters where they incorporate the notion of freshness into the traditional letor approach by generating hybrid labels based on relevance and freshness judgments similar to Dong et al. The clustering employed is a soft-clustering where each query is associated with all the clusters with different association weights.We started by identifying all the distinct hosts represented in the 100 gigabyte collection. The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.Many of such features cannot be easily integrated in the formulae of conventional retrieval models due to lack of theoretical foundations. One advantage of LETOR is that it allows incorporating features that addresses various characteristics of a document and its relevance to a topic.Any opinions  , findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the National Science Foundation. This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation  , under NSF grant IIS-0329090  , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.This allows us to compare our unsupervised contextualization technique to state-of-the-art techniques  , and possibly to participate in a future WSD challenge. Once the best feature set is established  , we are going to evaluate our contextualization on the SemEval 2010 20 and SemEval 2013 23 datasets.The MESUR reference data now consists of 1 billion individual usage events that were recorded at the documentlevel and processed as described above. Future analysis will focus on determining which request types most validly represent user interest.Table 1lists the five highest-ranked journals according to their usage 5 at LANL  , one of the initial usage data sets in the MESUR reference data set. This assumption seems to be confirmed by the pattern that emerges as the MESUR reference data set grows and becomes more diverse over time.The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines. To test the correctness of our SVM ranking algorithm and the correctness of the feature extractor we extracted features from the Million Query 2008 collection  , and performed a five-fold cross validation.Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists  , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method. We introduce a two-pass retrieval framework  , where in the first pass we aim to retrieve as many relevant document as possible to ensure a reasonable level of recall  , and in the second pass we process all the retrieved documents in the first pass and extract features.In detail  , in the first pass we use the standard Indri retrieval algorithm and BM25 with pseudo relevance feedback on the topby the length of the document. Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists  , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method.The LETOR-like selection methodology also selects very similar documents  , since the documents selected are those that give high BM25 values and thus have similar characteristics. At the other end of the discrepancy scale  , infAP for small sampling percentages selects the most diverse relevant documents while it converges fast to the average discrepancy between documents in the complete collection.Second  , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software  , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets. To repair a ous computation smell existing work on appropriate formula pattern in an array that suffers We evaluated our lyzed the EUSES corpus putation smells can formance of our smells.image or video files  , so the big-documents for such engines by concatenating the text from all its sampled pages would be empty  , which causes such resources would not be selected for any queries. In addition  , for some search engines  , like the resource e122 Picasa in FedWeb 2014  , all the sampled pages are non-text files  , e.g.Hence  , we only compare the proposal algorithm with Ranking-SVM  , but not Rank-Boost. The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this.Of the 197 occurrences of 'bank'  , the vector analysis correctly assigned 45 percent of them to the correct sense. Wilks manually disambiguated all occurrences of the word 'bank' within LDOCE according to the senses of its definition and compared this to the results of the cosine correlation.In particular  , the culprit was single-digit OCR errors in the scanned article year. This turned out to be an artifact of OCRed metadata.TD2004 have more relevant documents per topic than other LETOR collections  , relevant documents remain relatively sparse. As the histogram shows  , relevant documents per topic are quite sparse  , restricting the number of feedback iterations possible with stable evaluation.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents  , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data. The Disk4&5 collection contains newswire articles from various sources  , such as Association Press AP  , Wall Street Journal WSJ  , Financial Times FT  , etc.  , which are usually considered as high-quality text data with little noise.In general  , such a set of features is based on datasets and vocabularies used in some LOD collection  , e.g.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset. To describe the differences of the data models that express the same example instance with different vocabularies and vocabulary terms  , we make use of features such as the number of datasets using a vocabulary or the total occurrence of a vocabulary term.Further  , the discrepancy among the selected relevant documents   , along with the discrepancy among the selected relevant and non-relevant documents for the different selection methods is illustrated in Figures 2. The LETOR-like selection achieves both high precision and recall at small percentages of data used for training up to 5% and then it drops to the levels of statAP and depth pooling.The most comprehensive open access database for the area of chemistry is PubChem 14 . Generally  , this information can be retrieved from topic-centered databases.The first evaluation was conducted in early 2007 and the results were reported at the SemEval-2007 workshop. 07 and the participant's papers for details.In LETOR  , there are a total of 16 ,140 query-document pairs with relevance judgments  , and 25 extracted features. definitely  , possibly  , or not relevant.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset  , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method. SRimp: this is the social regularization method that uses the implicit social information.The relevancy judgments provided in OHSUMED are scored 0  , 1 or 2 and there are 45 features for each querydocument pair. The datasets provided in the LETOR There are 106 queries in the OSHUMED dataset.ACSys made that data available in two ways. Nick Craswell developed software for extracting hyper-link connectivity information from WT2g.But chemical articles contains both text and molecule structure images; we can only imagine what opportunities would we get by combining text data mining methods and cheminformatics search techniques. For example  , another popular database  , that provides substructure search functionality over more than 31 million chemical molecules  , is the PubChem database 2.were detailed earlier in this document. Figure 3below shows the precision at 5 -1000 documents returned from running the modified queries on WT2g.The proposed MESUR ontology is practical  , as opposed to all encompassing  , in that it represents those artifacts and properties that  , as previously shown in 4  , are realistically available from modern scholarly information systems. This article presents  , the OWL ontology 17 used by MESUR to represent bibliographic  , citation and usage data in an integrated manner.Indri query language is utilized to integrate the synonyms of all identified chemicals into the automatically constructed queries with its powerful capabilities using the {} operator to handle synonyms of identified chemical entities. After the chemical entities are extracted  , we include top 10 most commonly used synonyms of the identified chemicals from PubChem 4 in the query.A study conducted last year based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there are currently as many as 11 million end-user programmers in the United States  , compared to only * This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation under the grant ITR-0325273 and by the EUSES Consortium http://EUSESconsortium.org. In the original scenario  , once a template was created and loadedHowever  , the timeconsuming process of aggregation  , filtering  , parsing  , and deduplicating 1 billion usage events was terminated only recently . The MESUR reference data now consists of 1 billion individual usage events that were recorded at the documentlevel and processed as described above.The index matching service that finds all web pages containing certain keywords is heavy-tailed. The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com 2 with different size distribution characteristics: a database index matching service and a page ranking service.BRIGHTKITE. For privacy reasons  , we only consider pages clicked on by at least 50 distinct users  , and only consider users with at least 100 clicks.For our empirical analysis  , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012. The stream-based approach is also applicable to the full data crawls of D Datahub ,In Letor  , the data is represented as feature vectors and their corresponding relevance labels . There are 16 ,140 query-document pairs with relevance labels.Synonyms are the first type of words for which the TSA method seems to outperform the ESA method. Table 12presents additional examples of pairs belonging to these relations and the ranking of human judgments  , ESA and TSA algorithms for the WS-353 dataset.Some examples are: How does the snippet quality influence results merging strategies ? Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context  , there are also new research challenges that readily appear  , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.This paper addresses these questions by an empirical analysis that uses a part of a standard blog corpus: the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006. Q5 Last but not least  , which computational and empirical methods are suited to analyzing these questions ?The comparison results of TSA on the WS-353 dataset are reported in Table 1. Again  , TSA performs substantially better than ESA  , confirming that temporal information is useful on other datasets.While the triple store is still a maturing technology  , it provides many advantages over the relational database model. The MESUR project makes use of a triple store to represent and access its collected data.The newspaper data set made available to us ranges from 1618 to 1995 4 and consists of more than 102 million OCRed newspaper items. We used the default Snowball stemmer for Dutch 6 .Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR. Multiple LETOR methods have been tried  , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.UiSPP Linear combination of the Document-centric and Collection-centric models. This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection Nguyen et al.  , 2012.How to optimize towards diversity under the context LETOR is yet another problem to be studied in future. This is because we were counting on topic modelling based query expansion to improve diversity performance  , such that we have not defined a dedicated list-wise optimization criterion on top of the rank list that addresses diversity.Nevertheless  , in a setup similar to LETOR setup  , as in our experiments  , we show that substantially less documents than the ones used in LETOR can lead to similar performance of the trained ranking functions. Therefore  , in the case where hundreds of raw features are employed  , ranking functions may need more than 1% of the complete collection to achieve optimal performance.Prime examples are the substance database PubChem 1 combining several chemical entity data sources and the document search engine ChemXSeer 2 . In an attempt to overcome the costly access to chemical literature  , several groups are currently working on building free chemical search engines.Selecting word pairs to evaluate: To create a balanced dataset of both related words and unrelated words  , we applied the following procedure: Let W be a set of all words in the New York Times news articles. The relatedness of these pairs of words is then evaluated using human annotators   , as done in the WS-353 dataset.Not all nodes in this Semantic Web graph are entities; identifying the nodes which refer to an entity is one of the challenges introduced by the task. We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3   , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.illustrate ambiguous computation smells using extracted from the EUSES corpus to detect and repair these smells. concludes this paper.Explicit uncertainty information can  , of course  , be used for other purposes — for example  , to provide for the user a confidence level for each document in the ranking. However  , we have found little evidence  , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set  , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG.The model which optimizes per-item scores without recency outperforms the model that fixes the per-item scores to be item popularity over all datasets. Clearly  , the recency only model is the second best and the improvements by the hybrid model over the recency model are significant for MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE.Creating a reference data set: MESUR has invested significant energy to compile a large-scale col- 1 Pronounced " measure "   , an acronym for " Metrics from Scholarly Usage of Resources " . 1: 1.Following LETOR convention  , each dataset is divided into 5 folds with a 3:1:1 ratio for training  , validation  , and test set. 16  , here we investigate whether a simple unweighted average is sufficient to give improve- ments.the LETOR benchmark 5 requires only one parameter c as input. Since higher NDCG values are obtained when the most relevant results are ranked on the top followed by the less relevant and the irrelevant ones  , the above observation enforces our claim that our method favors the most relevant results of each query.All works propose interesting issues for SRC. Recently  , researchers from the same team proposed a new dataset within the context of the SEMEVAL task 11 28  , in which the goal is to provide an evaluation framework for the objective comparison of word sense disambiguation and induction algorithms in SRC for ambiguous queries.the number of query topics  , on ranking performance by conducting comparison study with varying the value of n. Figure 3show the performance of TRSVM on Letor dataset with varying values of n in terms of MAP. In this experiment  , we explore the effects of different settings of the parameter n  , i.e.Based on the observation  , title pages have relatively fewer number of text lines and larger average distance between text lines  , and they contain text lines indicating volume number and issue number in issue title pages. We use rule-based approach for title detection using page and line features calculated from OCRed text  , bounding box information  , and context analysis.Defining a model of the scholarly communication process represented as an RDF/OWL ontology 3. The MESUR project will proceed according to the following project phases: 1.The evaluation is done on three collections of tweets that were manually annotated to positive and negative classes: 6Hu- manCoded 5   , Sanders 6   , and SemEval 7 . To do this  , we compare the classification performance obtained by a simple classifier that uses attributes calculated from the seed lexicon  , with the performance obtained by a classifier with attributes derived from both the seed lexicon and the generated words.University dragon 16 Their result merging runs were based on normalizing the document score based on the resource score by a simple multiplication. Ultimately  , the rank based resource score combined with the document score on the RS baseline provided by the FedWeb team performed the best drexelRS7mW.The corpus has 4498 spreadsheets collected from various sources. The frequency of occurrences of cp-similar regions has been shown by the analysis carried out on the EUSES spreadsheet corpus as reported in 13.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of linear RankSVM. For all the SVM models in the experiment  , we employ the linear SVM.For evaluating the quality of a set of 10 results as returned by the resources in response to a test topic  , we use the relevance weights listed above to calculate the Graded Precision introduced by 11  as the generalized precision. These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection  , which has  , by construction  , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.Figure 5and Figure 6show the results on the Letor TD2003 and TD2004 datasets. We tried treating 'partially relevant' as 'irrelevant'  , it did not work well for SVM map .the entire WT2g Dataset  , both for inLinks and outLinks. Using recently acquired hardware we have reduced this time to below 2 seconds per query.The similar shapes for training and validation suggest that we are not overfitting. Secondly these all peak at or close to an α of 0  , indicating that  , for LETOR OHSUMED at least  , we don't get any benefit from explicit use of the model's uncertainty information .Each performance value on test sets shown in the figures is averaged using five-fold cross validation as the same way used in LETOR. By varying β from 0 to 1 with a step of 0.05  , the curves of the ranking performance of FocusedRank in terms of κ-NDCG 4 and κ-ERR are shown in Figure 1and Figure 2.This section presents various digital resources of each scanned volume  , selection of input for the metadata generation system  , the method for automatic metadata generation  , and the set of metadata elements generated by the system. Finally  , generated metadata information and OCRed text are integrated to support navigation and retrieval of content within scanned volumes.From Figure 1b and Figure 2 b  , we actually cannot find evidences that social friend information is correlated with user interest similarity. Secondly  , in the Douban friend community  , we obtain totally different trends.For SHAKESPEARE  , since the consumption is contrived  , there is no recency the real and permuted curves are near-identical  , which both validates our measure as capturing the amount of repeat consumption  , and shows that the separations in MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE are nontrivial . Interestingly  , caching on the permuted sequences is still higher on this measure than the stable top-k cache  , suggesting that temporally " local " preferences recently consumed items are more important than temporally " global " preferences all-time favorites.After deduplication   , there are about 886 million triples  , 175 million resources  , and 296 million literals. The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.As ODP- 239 is an evolution of AMBIENT and SEMEVAL is the next generation of MORESQUE  , we will only give an overview of the most recent datasets. Different gold standards have been used for the evaluation of SRC algorithms among which the most cited are: AMBIENT 6  , ODP-239 10  , MORESQUE 27 and SEMEVAL 28 .by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available  , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level  , e.g. – the effect of sampling strategy on resource selection effectiveness  , e.g.We compare the NDCG-Annealing algorithm with linear ranking function described in section 3 with baselines provided in the LETOR 3.0 datasets. The NDCG-Annealing algorithm is general to be applied to both linear and non-linear ranking functions at test time.This setting is employed to fairly compare the method SRimp with SRexp. Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset  , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.Table 5: Results of the Dual C-Means algorithm for ODP-239 and SEMEVAL. Let us notice that this is the only dataset for which experiments with query logs can be performed and easily reproduced.The frequency of occurrences of cp-similar regions has been shown by the analysis carried out on the EUSES spreadsheet corpus as reported in 13. Similarities in spreadsheet formulas have been exploited in consistency checking 16 and testing of spreadsheets 8.To avoid the aforementioned implication  , these extra documents with low BM25 scores were dropped in the latest LETOR release 13. This is a highly counterintuitive outcome.These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection  , which has  , by construction  , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset. We see that the best resource depending on the queries from the General search engines achieves the highest number of relevant results and/or the results with the highest levels of relevance  , followed by the Blogs  , Kids  , and Video verticals.This diagram primarily serves as a reference. Figure 6 presents the complete taxonomy of the MESUR ontology.Table 1shows the statistics of the datasets included in the LETOR 3.0 benchmark. For these datasets  , there are 64 features extracted for each query-document pair and a binary relevance judgment for each pair is provided.In order to do this  , the MESUR project makes use of a representative collection of bibliographic  , citation and usage data. on the basis of scholarly usage.However  , IMRank1 runs more than two orders of magnitude faster than PMIA and more than one order of magnitude faster than IRIE. On the DOUBAN network  , the four algorithms achieve comparable influence spread.It should be noted that for different classes of requests  , an application may deploy different termination ranges and control parameters and our API design can support such differentiation. Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.Figure 1provides a general overview of the the various stages of the MESUR project. The MESUR project will develop metrics using various algorithms drawn from graph theory  , semantic network theory  , and statistics  , along with theoretical techniques developed internal to the project and cross-validated with existing metrics such as the ISI IF  , the Usage Impact Factor 3  , and the Y-Factor 1.Table 2summarizes the total performance of BCDRW and BASIC methods in terms of precision and coverage on the aforementioned DouBan data set. The impact of using different values of α  , β and N is further studied in the second set of experiments reported in Section 4.3.2.However  , we have found little evidence  , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set  , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG. The ability of our models to take into account different levels of uncertainty for different data produces effective models  , and  , for FITC-Rank in particular  , performance is consistent across experiments and gives significant improvements against the baseline models.Nick Craswell developed software for extracting hyper-link connectivity information from WT2g. It is not known at this stage  , what proportion of the dead links those whose target lies outside WT2g are inter-server links and how many are references to same-server pages which happen to be missing from the VLC2 1 .Table 2summarizes the performance of our model on five test sets using three parameter initialization schemas. We report the results for training the network on the official supervised dataset from Semeval'15 using parameters that were initialized: i completely at random Random; ii using word embeddings from the neural language model trained on a large unsupervised dataset Unsup with the word2vec tool and iii initializing all the parameters of our model with the parameters of the network that uses the word embeddings from the previous step and are further tuned on a distant supervised dataset Distant.The user-related and item-related contexts are the same with those used in Douban book data. 3 Douban music data 16  , which records 1 ,387 ,216 ratings from 29 ,287 users on 257 ,288 music items.SRexp: this is the social regularization method described in Equation 3  , which utilizes the explicit social information in improving recommender systems. We compare the following three methods using Douban datasets: 1.We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models. We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting  , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model.They may be classified as distinct documents by some users  , and duplicates by some others. Similarly  , a digital document may exist in different media types  , such as plain text  , HTML  , I&TEX  , DVI  , postscript  , scanned-image  , OCRed text  , or certain PC-a.pplication format.To illustrate the effects of some of these design considerations figure 1shows three precision curves obtained using the WT2g collection and short queries. To be more concrete  , we present next some of the precision vs. pruning results using standard MAP and P@10 measures.The results obtained  , however  , with the FedWeb 2013 collection are completely different see Table 7. We present in the table only the best values for each of them Jelinek LM for the description field and TF-IDF for the title  and an additional method BM25 desc which will serve us as reference later.We manually validated the 1 ,423 detected conformance errors in the 700 sampled cell arrays. In Table 3   , AmCheck detected a total of 8 ,481 conformance errors CE1 in the EUSES corpus.We expect the pairwise methods to perform better than point-wise approaches  , as the features collected from the error pairs are more meaningful as they define relative distances. We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR  , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic. The second and third requirements ruled out a uniform 2 % sample. Resource selection: given a query  , a set of search engines/resources and a set of sample documents for each resource  , the goal of this task is to return a ranked list of search engines according to their relevance given the query. In FedWeb 2014  , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.  , news  , blogs  , videos etc.The results on seven datasets in LETOR 3.0 show that the NDCG-Annealing algorithm can outperform the baselines and it is more stable. We compare the NDCG-Annealing algorithm with linear ranking function described in section 3 with baselines provided in the LETOR 3.0 datasets.The first evaluation  , based on the LETOR datasets 17  , uses manual relevance assessments as ground-truth labels and synthetic clicks as feedback to BARACO. in two different ways.The MESUR ontology is currently at version 2007-01 at http://www.mesur.org/schemas/2007-01/mesur abbreviated mesur. The following sections will describe how bibliographic and usage data is modeled to meet the requirements of understanding large-scale usage behavior  , while at the same time promoting scalabil- ity.All of them are available online but distributed throughout the Web. Babelfy has been evaluated using six datasets: three from earlier SemEval tasks 33  , 29  , 28  , one from a Senseval task 38 and two already used for evaluating AIDA 17  , 16.To repair a ous computation smell existing work on appropriate formula pattern in an array that suffers We evaluated our lyzed the EUSES corpus putation smells can formance of our smells. We tection to a constraint satisfaction problem.We took SPARQL Endpoints from the SPARQLES survey 3  , vocabularies from Linked Open Vocabularies LOV 2 and prefix.cc  , and we augmented these data with spidered data from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2014 13 dataset. We made several approaches to ensure that we visited a large and representative section of the open Semantic Web.We have implemented most of our ranking algorithms implemented using Lucene. Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible  , without using any external processing engine or resources  , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit.In particular  , and as will be discussed in detail in Section 3  , we use keyword extraction in a subroutine to efficiently find a small subset of diverse keyqueries. A survey of current research in the field is given in the overview paper of the 2010 SemEval competition on keyphrase extraction 9.The out-links file consisted of  , for each document d  , the document numbers of the documents d links to. Accordingly  , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.Formal releases of these two broswers are expected to fix these problems. All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.The TWSI dataset is mostly used for parameter tuning and determining the best feature configuration. It contains contextualized substitutions for about 150 ,000 sentences  , a larger collection than used for SemEval WSD tasks.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data  , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500. First  , we observe that the degree distributions are greatly affected by the existence of splogs.The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this. Note that it is commonly believed that Rank-Boost performs equally well as Ranking SVM.With LETOR data  , since HP and NP are similar tasks but TD is rather different  , we conducted experiments on HP03- to-NP04 and NP03-to-TD04 adaptation  , where the former setting is for adapting to a similar domain and the latter for adapting to a distinct one. The free parameters λs and λt were set such that λs λt is inversely proportional to |Ds| |Dt|As another example  , in case the program can not recognize the volume and issue number due to OCR error  , such as " IV " was OCRed as " it "   , the program will use the previous or the following title page information  , if available  , to construct the current volume or issue metadata. For instance  , in order to tolerate OCR errors in volume and issue number line  , we set the Levenshtein Distance20 between an examined string and the target " volume " and " issue " keywords as a parameter and choose the optimal value based on experiments.Thus  , these results indicate that training over a collection of given characteristics cannot always lead to an effective ranking function when the function is deployed to rank documents in a collection of radically different characteristics. The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines.Table 1summarizes the statistics of this dataset  , where Words per review represents the text length of a review and Distinct Words per review represents the number of distinct word units that occur in a review. Because only the most popular tags are listed for the books in DouBan  , we obtained merely 135 distinct tags.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research. Large Linked Datasets.8 we observe that the results share the similar trends with Douban data based experiments. From Fig.We present a principled method to create additional datasets  , as opposed to the WS-353 benchmark where the word pairs were extracted manually. As an effort to provide additional evaluation data in this problem domain  , we created a new dataset 1 to further evaluate our results upon.The ability of our models to take into account different levels of uncertainty for different data produces effective models  , and  , for FITC-Rank in particular  , performance is consistent across experiments and gives significant improvements against the baseline models. We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.Deep analysis shows that ARI embodies an interesting property for the SRC task as it is well-known that the sizes of the clusters are not distributed equally on the Web. For SEMEVAL  , the best performances are provided by STC in terms of ARI and LINGO in terms of F N 1 .Letor OHSUMED dataset consists of articles from medical journals . In the first experiment  , we used the Letor benchmark datasets 18: OHSUMED  , TD2003  , and TD2004.This comprises articles  , advertisements  , ocial notifications  , and the captions of illustrations see Table 1for details. The newspaper data set made available to us ranges from 1618 to 1995 4 and consists of more than 102 million OCRed newspaper items.Hence  , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity. This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.We started from the 506 topics gathered for FedWeb 2013 5  , leaving out the 200 topics provided to the FedWeb 2013 participants. </narrative> </topic>Features in Letor OHSUMED dataset consists of 'low-level' features and 'high-level' features. In Letor  , the data is represented as feature vectors and their corresponding relevance labels .Our LETOR algorithms behave differently on some topics  , but Condorcet method tends to ignore high votes from the minority  , but instead prefer weak votes from the majority. This observation is similar to that in 22  , and it is likely to be the case that false positives that are common in all 4 posting lists will likely to receive higher ranking than true positives that are supported by a subset of posting lists. Journal-level usage events: All article-level usage events were converted to journal-level usage events to facilitate the interpretation and cross-validation of initial results. The preliminary results discussed in the following sections were generated on the basis of an early subset of the MESUR data set that was selected to offer the best possible outcomes at the time:  200 million article-level usage events: A subset consisting of the most thoroughly validated and deduplicated usage events.Without existing benchmark dataset  , we used Review Spider to collect reviews from a Chinese website DouBan to form our experiment dataset. Then we only need to invert the matrix once in the first iteration  , but not in subsequent iterations.In the experiment in disambiguating the 197 occurrences of 'bank' within LDOCE  , Wilks found a number of cases where none of the senses was clearly 'the right one' Wilks 891. In addition  , it is not always clear just what the 'correct sense' is.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 . In the experiments we use one graph instance for each targeted application area  , i.e.  , product recommendation on shopping websites  , collaborator and patent recommendation in academia  , friend recommendation on social networks  , and personalized web search.The FedWeb 2013 collection contains search result pages for many other queries  , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages. Participants had to rank the 157 search engines for each test topic without access to the corresponding search results.For each scanned volume  , the metadata generation system takes the DjVu XML file as input and parses the hierarchy of objects contained within the file. Thus  , line features are designed to estimate properties of OCRed text within a line  , which can be calculated based on OCRed text and bounding box information in the DjVu XML file.regression trees on large data sets  , since the required tree depth grows with increasing data set size. We observe up to 25 fold speedups in this distributed setting for the Microsoft LETOR data set.Singhal and Kaszkiel 4 looked at average in-and out-links  , within and across hosts  , between the smaller WT2g corpus and their own large crawl. To answer that  , we first need to understand more about what the web looks like.We thus examined whether tapping the co-commenting patterns of a user's friends can help improve our personalized recommendation for the user. Furthermore  , the Newsvine friendship relations are publicly crawlable.NIST assessors referred to the WT2g collection during the process of ad hoc topic generation. Naturally  , there may be considerable variation from one topic to another.There were two t ypes of content-and-link runs used; a very simple sibling relationship implementation  , and another version that aimed to overcome some of the simpler run's short- comings. Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.We also perform a dataset analysis and develop a cost model that provide insight into why particular strategies are effective for Web Data. Experiments are performed on Web data taken from the Billion Triple Challenge and the Web Data Commons datasets.Table 6shows the results obtained for some of these methods with the FedWeb 2012 collection. For the resource selection task we tested different variations of the strategies presented above.Basic methods that we used for these tasks will be described in section 2. We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site. These browsers cover the most wellknown layout engines  , such as Trident and Gecko  , as well as several widely used JavaScript engines.We analyzed the data to classify values into categories. We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section  , which contains a high concentration of string data 10.First 100 elements obtained from three different ranking methods  , tf -idf   , BM 25  , and Rejection are pair-wise compared in Figure 5. Documents in both D1 and D2 Figure 5 are drawn from dataset collection WT2G where |D1| = |D2| = 2500  , |T1| = 50961 and |T2| = 127487. LETOR: For comparison purposes  , a LETOR-like document selection methodology is also employed. Hedge finds many relevant documents " common " to various retrieval systems   , thus documents likely to contain many of the query words.As our method also captures co-occurrences of words in a single article as we construct time-series aggregated over all articles on a certain date  , phrases can also be identified well. The rankings are based on the rank of the similarity of the pair of words out of the 353 pairs in the WS-353 dataset.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data. Due to the lack of In addition to topics 401-450  , we have executed a number of manual queries on the software.Furthermore  , the MESUR project aims to contribute to the study of large-scale semantic networks. This model can be juxtaposed to the citation-driven monoculture that presently prevails in the assessment of scholarly status.ing monthly harvest of fruits. illustrate ambiguous computation smells using extracted from the EUSES corpus to detect and repair these smells.A survey of current research in the field is given in the overview paper of the 2010 SemEval competition on keyphrase extraction 9. Actually  , we chose the term keyquery in dependence on these two concepts.52 % of these links reference another document within WT2g but only 0.12 % reference a different server within WT2g. On average  , each document within the collection includes 9.13 outgoing links.We choose the Douban data 8 because it contains not only time/date related and other inferred contextual information  , but also social relationships information  , thus is suitable for evaluating the performance of SoCo  , which utilizes various types of information. Note that we only use explicit ratings  , i.e.  , the " wish " expressions are not considered to be ratings.An important new condition in the Results Merging task  , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task  , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run. Different evaluation measures are shown: 1. nDCG@20 official RS metric  , with the gain of duplicates set to zero see below  , and where the reference covers all results over all resources.They experimented with a baseline run utTailyM400  , and a variation using a Gaussian distribution instead of a Gamma distribution utTailyNormM400. In comparison with their original publication   , the FedWeb submission assumed that all resources are of the same size.Figure 6shows these curves as a function of the cache size k for MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE  , and for comparison  , SHAKE- SPEARE and YES. We also compute a separate baseline to account for the most heavily consumed items: we calculate and report the fraction of hits when the cache is fixed to always contain the top k most frequently consumed items.Therefore  , we have adopted Reciprocal Rank as the data fusion techniques in our final submissions. Our LETOR algorithms behave differently on some topics  , but Condorcet method tends to ignore high votes from the minority  , but instead prefer weak votes from the majority.This logical structure information can be used to help the metadata extraction process. In each DjVu XML file  , the OCRed text is organized in a page  , paragraph  , line  , and word hierarchy.The item consumed in this case is the check-in location given by its anonymized identity and geographical coordinates. BrightKite is a now defunct location-based social networking website www.brightkite.com where users could publicly check-in to various locations.Experimental results manifest that RSRank not only achieves good sparsity in practice  , but also exhibits a high level of performance in comparison with several proposed baseline algorithms. Finally  , we evaluate the proposed method on LETOR 3.0 benchmark collections1.See Figure 4for an example of the results generated by a query "Vegetable Soup Recipes". Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.Ranking functions exhibit their second worst performance when trained over data sets constructed according to the LETOR-like document selection methodology. the performance of RankBoost  , Regression and RankNet with the hidden layer.The results also suggest that query terms are valuable information for sake of ranking. Experimental results  , obtained using the LETOR benchmark  , indicate that methods that learn to rank at query-time outperform the state-ofthe-art methods.This context provides the hint that the user may not be interested in the search service provided by www.ask.com but instead be interested in the background information of the company. ask.com before query " Ask Jeeves " .Similarly to such tasks  , our dataset is composed of a large set of triples coming from LOD datasets  , while our queries consist of entities extracted from news articles and the gold standard is manually created by experts. Most of the proposed systems for this task see for example 6 exploit IR indexing and ranking techniques over the RDF dataset used at the Billion Triple Challenge 2009.After excluding splogs from the BlogPulse data  , we 14 for the BlogPulse dataset  , we replicate the result that the cumulative in-degree and out-degree distributions show smoother curves  , as shown in Figure 3.The primary objective of the MESUR project is to study the relationship between usage-based value metrics e.g. TheThese data sets were chosen because they are publicly available  , include several baseline results  , and provide evaluation tools to ensure accurate comparison between methods. For meta search aggregation problem we use the LETOR 14  benchmark datasets.Since the document relevance inferred from the PCC and DBN models is better than that from the CCM model in the above two experiments  , we only consider the PCC and DBN models in this part of experiment. For each query and document  , we extract about three hundred of features in the experiment  , where the features are similar to those defined in LETOR16.On the other three collections  , the performance of all the three PRoc models is very close. In addition  , from Table 4 we observe that PRoc3 outperforms the other two on the WT2G collection.Therefore  , uncertainty quantification is important to MESUR as it will help to assess the reliability of results obtained from mining the reference data set. It should be noted that both the filtering and de-duplication sub-tasks are inherently statistical procedures  , and that the achieved success rates influence the quality of the reference data set.This includes bibliographic data such as author  , title  , identifier  , publication date and usage data such as the IP address of the accessing agent  , the date and time of access  , type of usage  , etc. The proposed MESUR ontology is practical  , as opposed to all encompassing  , in that it represents those artifacts and properties that  , as previously shown in 4  , are realistically available from modern scholarly information systems.Since MESUR follows an approach of usage data analysis inspired by clickstream concepts 12  , 11 grouping events is an essential processing sub-task that needs to be performed before ingesting the usage data into the reference data set. Session-based grouping: Usage data is typically recorded and hence provided to MESUR as a time-sequential list of individual events recorded by an information system; different events generated by the same agent in the course of a certain time span are not grouped.The results strongly point towards the imminent feasibility of usage-based metrics of impact. This paper has described preliminary results derived from an analysis of a subset of the MESUR reference data set that consists of over 200 million article-level usage events.Session identifiers  , anonymized user identifiers  , anyonymized IP addresses  , and event timestamps are information elements that are at the core of this process. Since MESUR follows an approach of usage data analysis inspired by clickstream concepts 12  , 11 grouping events is an essential processing sub-task that needs to be performed before ingesting the usage data into the reference data set.This is not surprising  , as the BlogPulse blog data was used as a source set of blog urls for harvesting blog author profiles. The match between geolocation and language improves when we compare location breakdown with the language breakdown for blogs collected by BlogPulse in October 2006.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection. Therefore  , if A is relevant and B  , A's sibling  , has similar content to A then it is likely that B is relevant a s w ell.Using large language model with and word co-occurrences  , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013  , task 13 23. trigram or dependency features.We determine the effectiveness of our algorithm in relation to semi-supervised text classification algorithm proposed in 5 NB-EM. We randomly split SRAA and WebKB datasets such that 80% is used as training data and remaining 20% is used as test data.The first is the unique document found containing both of the words " income " and " forecast " as well as the American Tobacco Company logo and a dollar amount a recognized entity type greater than $500K. We apply conjunctive constraints on document image components to a straightforward document ranking based on total query-word frequency in the OCRed document text; in Fig- ure 2we show document images retrieved for two such queries.However  , even in the 7 categories where programmers have published regexps on the web  , or where we could convert dropdown or radio button widgets to regexps  , F 1 was only 0.31 the same accuracy as Condition 4 in those categories  , owing to a lack of regexps for unusual international formats that were present in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus. F 1 would likely be higher if programmers were in the habit of validating more fields.Very few text analysis tools can  , for example  , deal with different confidence values in their input  , apart from the extensive standardization these would require for the input/output formats and interpretation of these values. For task T4 not in the table  , the use of OCRed texts in other tools  , our findings are also mainly negative.BRIGHTKITE. We describe each of the datasets in detail below.While a trim ontology has been presented  , the effects of this ontology on load and query times is still inconclusive. The MESUR project was started in October of 2006 and thus  , is still in its early stages of development.We collected concrete examples of research tasks  , and classified them into categories. Through interviews we conducted with scholars  , we learned that while the uncertain quality of OCRed text in archives is seen as a serious obstacle to wider adaption of digital methods in the humanities  , few scholars can quantify the impact of OCR errors on their own research tasks.When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered  , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents  , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks  , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible  , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents  , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents. The LETOR-like selection methodology also selects very similar documents  , since the documents selected are those that give high BM25 values and thus have similar characteristics.Session-based grouping: Usage data is typically recorded and hence provided to MESUR as a time-sequential list of individual events recorded by an information system; different events generated by the same agent in the course of a certain time span are not grouped. 4.Actually  , the results of Ranking SVM are already provided in LETOR. In comparison with this baseline  , we can see whether Relational Ranking SVM can effectively leverage relation information to perform better ranking.This indicates that cell arrays are common in real-life spreadsheets. Our empirical study reports that there are altogether 16 ,385 cell arrays among 993 out of 4 ,037 spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus 11.We use rule-based approach for title detection using page and line features calculated from OCRed text  , bounding box information  , and context analysis. In terms of the mapping between page index  , the index of a scanned page in the viewable PDF file  , and page number  , the number printed on the original volume  , the program recognizes available page numbers on scanned pages by analyzing the OCRed text in particular areas of pages.The proposed poster is divided into two primary components . Another significant component of the MESUR project is the development of a scholarly ontology that represents bibliographic  , citation  , usage concepts  , along with concepts for expressing different artifact metrics.The MESUR ontology was engineered to make a distinction between required base-relationships and those  , that if needed  , can be inferred from the baserelations . Finally  , the proposed ontology was engineered to handle an extremely large semantic network instantiation on the order of 50 million articles with a corresponding 1 billion usage events.We observe up to 25 fold speedups in this distributed setting for the Microsoft LETOR data set. Fold 1 n=723K Set 1 n=473K Set 2 n=35K Perfect Figure 4: The speedups of pGBRT on the cluster as a function of CPU cores.Table 7: Optimal hyper-parameter on all retrieval methods over both types of verbose queries tuned for MAP on WT2g. Figure 2: Performance trend MAP as the single smoothing hyper-parameter λ  , µ  , and ω changes for each language model on the WT2g tuning collection for description only queries top and for description and narrative queries bottom.We crawled all the users in these groups  , and used these users as seeds to further crawl their social networks with their movie ratings. At the time when were crawling Douban web site November 2009  , there were more than 700 groups under the " Movie " subcategory.These collection are indexed using Lucene SOLR 4.0 and we use BM25 as the retrieval model. Six collections  , relevant to the assignment about television and film personalities  , from various archives were indexed: 1 a television program collection containing 0.5M metadata records; 2 a photo collection with 20K photos of people working at television studio; 3 a wiki dedicated to actors and presenters 20K pages; 4 25K television guides that are scanned and OCRed; 5 scanned and OCRed newspapers between 1900 and 1995 6M articles; and 6 digital newspapers between 1995 and 2010 1M articles.In contrast with the previous standard benchmark  , WS-353  , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below  , which eliminates subjective selection of words. Finally  , empirical evaluation shows that TSA exhibits superior performance compared to the previous state of the art method ESA  , and achieves higher correlation with human judgments on both datasets.This results in irregular shapes for the cumulative degree distributions  , which represent the proportion of blogs having at least k in-links or out-links. Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data  , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.Since the data is from many different semantic data sources  , it contains many different ontologies. The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .The MESUR project makes use of a triple store to represent and access its collected data. This design choice was a major factor that prompted the engineering of a new ontology for bibliographic and usage modeling.7 The MESUR website offers detailed information on metric definitions and abbreviations: http://www.mesur.org/ With the addition of the Thomson Scientific journal Impact Factor a set of 47 metrics of scholarly impact result.The EUSES corpus consists of 4 ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories. We observe that ambiguous computation smells occur commonly in the corpus:And we hopped to be able to generate weighted distribution of words that could potentially identify multiple topics of a query from the top ranked documents  , and by using these approximations of multiples topics  , we can perform multiple searches for the same query with different expansions  , followed by separate LETOR for each expanded query  , and eventually merge the results with data fusion. Originally  , this was performed after the first pass when most of the relevant documents are assumed to be retrieved by using BM25 and Indri with pseudo relevance feedback .We apply conjunctive constraints on document image components to a straightforward document ranking based on total query-word frequency in the OCRed document text; in Fig- ure 2we show document images retrieved for two such queries. We consider integrated queries that our prototype makes possible for the first time.Figure 4shows the results on Letor OHSUMED dataset in terms of MAP and NDCG  , averaged over five trials. We conducted 5-fold cross validation experiments  , following the guideline of Letor.The nature of GP algorithms is also prone to overfitting. According to the authors  , GP based LETOR was able to achieve competitive performance with RankSVM and RankBoost  , but its computational cost is higher.We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation  , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction   , which is absent in many of the public datasets. These amount to roughly 100k transactions by 34k consumers on 30k products in the testing dataset.For meta search aggregation problem we use the LETOR 14  benchmark datasets. Given an aggregate ranking π  , and relevance levels L  , NDCG is defined as:Since its creation in 2005  , it has been widely used for spreadsheet research and evaluation. The EUSES corpus consists of 4 ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories.Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability. As an instance of the method  , we optimize NDCG in this paper  , but other metrics in ranking can also be applied directly.BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection. Therefore   , it is fair to compare them on these four collections.i word embeddings are initialized using a neural language model 4  , 7  , which is trained on a large unsupervised collection of tweets; ii we use a convolutional neural network to further refine the embeddings on a large distant supervised corpus 1; iii the word embeddings and other parameters of the network obtained at the previous stage are used to initialize the network with the same architecture  , which is then trained on a supervised corpus from Semeval-2015. In particular  , if we ranked all systems including ours according to their accuracy on each of the six test sets and compute their average ranks  , our model would be ranked first in both subtasks  , A and B.The WT2g connectivity data see http://pastime.anu.edu.au/WAR/WT2g_Links/ilink_WTonly.gz and the Small Web qrels file were used to find the set of documents which link directly to relevant documents. ACSys has attempted to determine whether this was the case by looking at the indirectly relevant documents retrieved by the runs listed in Table 7.There are 106 queries in the collection. Letor OHSUMED dataset consists of articles from medical journals .Each data set is partitioned on queries to perform 5 fold cross-validation. The results of RankSVM  , RankBoost  , AdaRank and FRank are reported in the Letor data set.For instance  , the MESUR ontology does not have a direct relationship between an article and its publishing journal. OntologyX uses context classes as the " glue " for relating other classes  , an approach that was adopted for the MESUR ontology.The MESUR project was started in October of 2006 and thus  , is still in its early stages of development. A novel approach to data representation was defined that leverages both relational database and triple store technology.If users are satiating on items  , we expect to see some k for which the probability of continuing runs decreases as the run length Figure 5: Lack of satiation in MAPCLICKS  , BRIGHTKITE  , and GPLUS. In Figure 5  , we show this curve for several of our datasets.The second evaluation  , based on the WSDM 2014 Web search personalization challenge  , 1 uses dwell time as ground-truth labels and real clicks as feedback to BARACO. The first evaluation  , based on the LETOR datasets 17  , uses manual relevance assessments as ground-truth labels and synthetic clicks as feedback to BARACO.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies. Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.The classic Rocchio's model  , fails to obtain improvement on the WT2G collection. The effectiveness of pseudo relevance feedback is reconfirmed in this set of experiments.From those terms  , chemical entities are extracted and synonyms for the identified chemical entities are also included from PubChem. TF–IDF scores are chosen for each to construct the queries.Thus  , line features are designed to estimate properties of OCRed text within a line  , which can be calculated based on OCRed text and bounding box information in the DjVu XML file. Additionally  , text within the same line usually has the same style.Here we consider the consumed items to be all latitude-longitude pairs of anonymized user check-ins. BrightKite was a location-based social networking website where users could check in to physical locations.Table 9gives the numbers of directly and indirectly relevant documents. The WT2g connectivity data see http://pastime.anu.edu.au/WAR/WT2g_Links/ilink_WTonly.gz and the Small Web qrels file were used to find the set of documents which link directly to relevant documents.This analysis indicates that the consumption of items strongly exhibit recency  , which we will model in Section 4.1. The behavior of caching for all the other datasets are in line with MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE. LETOR: Using only statistical features associated with matched terms features L1−10 and H1−3 in Tab. 1.Four thousand queries were adopted to gather samples from the diverse search engines; these samples were the basis for building descriptions for the informative resources at the various levels search engines and verticals. These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.Traditional benchmark databases  , such as Wieconein and AS3AP  , are primarily geared toward8 performance assessment of the algorithm8 in relation to the architecture . The experiment8 foreseen require care in the design and population of the test databases.With LETOR  , in contrast  , features capture general properties of query-document compatibility . For example  , while the word " dog " might be very important to the current query  , RF on this query cannot tell us anything about how important this word should be for other queries.The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations. Projections.The preliminary results discussed in the following sections were generated on the basis of an early subset of the MESUR data set that was selected to offer the best possible outcomes at the time:  200 million article-level usage events: A subset consisting of the most thoroughly validated and deduplicated usage events. However  , the timeconsuming process of aggregation  , filtering  , parsing  , and deduplicating 1 billion usage events was terminated only recently .We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting  , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model. The Gaussian process allows the smoothing uncertainties in SoftRank to reflect modelling uncertainty in the learnt score function.Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes. We let the officers study these smells before our interview.It is not known at this stage  , what proportion of the dead links those whose target lies outside WT2g are inter-server links and how many are references to same-server pages which happen to be missing from the VLC2 1 . 52 % of these links reference another document within WT2g but only 0.12 % reference a different server within WT2g.For technology survey  , we proposed a chemical terminology expansion algorithm with the professional chemical domain information from two chemical websites  , ChemID plus and PubChem. 3how to deal with long queries in Prior Art PA task ?With the increasing number of topics  , i.e. The performance of runs is measured by the nDCG@20  , which is the main evaluation metric used at the FedWeb research selection task.The doc id is a internally generated identifier created during the MESUR project's ingestion process. Note that the connection between the bibliographic record and the usage event occurs through the doc id bolded properties.Each database shard included a dimensional data model for its portion of the collection  , and a dimensional index of PubChem 8 terminology for synonym identification. For example  , one shard for EP 000000  , one shard for EP 000001  , one shard for US 020060  , etc.On the other hand  , the boosting method is highly dependent on the ranking of the resources  , as we observe when a better resource selection method is used BM25 desc in FedWeb 2013 or the hybrid run in FedWeb 2012. This suggests that  , when the resource ranking is not good the performance of the hybrid method in resource selection is far from optimal  , the diversification approach seems to help a little bit.The application of opinion modules is similar to on-topic retrieval optimization in that opinion scores generated by modules act as opinion reranking factors to boost the ranks of opinionated blogs in the topic-reranked results. We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.From randomly sampled smells  , 434 error computation smells previously created can help end users the quality of their We summarize main contributions of this paper  Second  , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software  , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.dataset by merging the original partitions into a single set  , and splitting the sorted queries into 5 folds  , distributed using the same proportions: 3 folds for training  , 1 for validation and 1 for test. For comparative purposes  , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure  , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO!As a result  , all usage data in the MESUR reference data set is anonymized both regarding individual and institutional identity. Most agreements thus contain explicit statements with this regard.Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category  , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories. We manually grouped the 66 unvalidated text fields into 42 categories   , such as person  , organization  , and education level.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation  , under NSF grant IIS-0329090  , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770. We would like to thank Andrew Ko and Justin Weisz for their valuable help with this paper.We use a non-linear Random Forest regression model for our experiments. To create features for the selection framework  , we use the published test runs 1 for these rankers to obtain the document scores for top 10 ranking documents  , and the list of 64 features that are available as part of LETOR.Instead  , there exists a publishing context that serves as an N-ary operator uniting a journal  , the article  , its publication date  , its authors  , and auxiliary information such as the source of the bibliographic data. For instance  , the MESUR ontology does not have a direct relationship between an article and its publishing journal.The list-wise approach was proved to be more effective than pairwise and point-wise approaches  , as its optimization criterion is closer to the actual evaluation metrics. For list-wise LETOR  , we are using ListNet 6  , which uses a simple one layer Neural Network with Gradient Decent to optimize a defined list-wise loss function based on " top one probability " .Furthermore  , unlike on LETOR where the performance of ActiveAda-S-T converges more quickly than others  , we do not observe any trend of convergence up to the point with 2000 selected queries. It is more likely that these cross-domain relevant knowledge in source domain are even more helpful than those most informative target queries identified by Active-T.The SVMRank 5 algorithm was used in this task and five-folds cross validation was done. Since a lot of features of LETOR we cannot get  , we droped those columns and then trained the ranking model.One area where none of the standards provided duced above was far from trivial. Some users are interested in highly unstructured text data OCRed from field journals  , or more conventional relational tables of data  , so BigSur does not require that these super-classes are used.In Figure 1  , the performance variations on graded MQ2007 are represented as curves with open symbols while that on0.0 0 . Each performance value on test sets shown in the figures is averaged using five-fold cross validation as the same way used in LETOR.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications  , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites. In this paper  , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.To assess word relatedness  , we use the WS-353 benchmark dataset  , available online 14  , which contains 353 word pairs. Evaluating word relatedness is a natural ability humans have and is  , therefore  , considered a common baseline.As such  , we validated the results by ourselves partially and manually in due diligence. One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.The Spambase Database is derived from a collection of spam and non-spam e-mails and consists of 4601 instances with 57 numeric attributes. The Ionosphere Database consists of 351 instances with 34 numeric attributes and contains 2 classes  , which come from a classiication of radar returns from the ionosphere .Section 2 describes the size  , origin  , and representation of the MESUR reference data set. This article introduces preliminary results from the MESUR project  , all of which strongly confirm the potential of scholarly usage data as a tool to study the dynamics of scholarship in real time  , and to form the basis for the definition of novel metrics of scholarly impact.OntologyX also helped to determine the primary abstract classes for the MESUR ontology. The context construct is intuitive and allows for future extensions to the ontology.The ranking is based on about 1.5 million usage events. Table 1lists the five highest-ranked journals according to their usage 5 at LANL  , one of the initial usage data sets in the MESUR reference data set.Generating maps of science: MESUR produces maps of science on the basis of its reference data set. 3.We evaluate the three strategies of generating resource representations as discussed in Section 2.2  , with varying numbers of topics K in training the LDA topic model. Table 1shows the results obtained by evaluating our resource selection approaches on the FedWeb 2013 collection.This is because we were counting on topic modelling based query expansion to improve diversity performance  , such that we have not defined a dedicated list-wise optimization criterion on top of the rank list that addresses diversity. It is also worth noticing that even though most of these features are directly consistent to the relevance of a document to a query  , none of our LETOR methods include diversity into account .To achieve higher accuracy than we did with topes  , programmers would need to combine numerous international formats into a single regexp for each data category  , which stands in stark contrast to current practice. However  , even in the 7 categories where programmers have published regexps on the web  , or where we could convert dropdown or radio button widgets to regexps  , F 1 was only 0.31 the same accuracy as Condition 4 in those categories  , owing to a lack of regexps for unusual international formats that were present in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus.We can observe that the PLM improves performance on WT2G and FR clearly and consistently  , which shows that  , similar to general passage retrieval  , the PLM can bring added benefits to document retrieval when documents are relatively long. The results are shown in Figure 4  , where we vary the smoothing parameters for both smoothing methods on all the four data sets.We do suggest caution being taken when reviewing the Small Web Task to take the results in the context of the WT2g dataset  , lest one conclude that Connectivity Analysis does not improve precision in any case. It is our understanding that any implementation of these approaches would not succeed in improving precision to any usable extent  , if at all when the experiments were based on the WT2g dataset  , due to the lack of Functional links.It contains contextualized substitutions for about 150 ,000 sentences  , a larger collection than used for SemEval WSD tasks. To evaluate the performance of the contextualization system  , we are going to use the TWSI dataset 4 here as well.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection. We evaluate our approach using the evaluation framework used in the Semantic Search Challenge 2010 3 .Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study. As such  , we validated the results by ourselves partially and manually in due diligence.Table 1shows the results obtained by evaluating our resource selection approaches on the FedWeb 2013 collection. In Section 3  , we evaluate the performance with different K values.These long requests are often kept running because the number of such requests is small  , and derived results can be cached for future use. For example in Ask.com search site  , some uncached requests may take over one second but such a query will be answered quickly next time from a result cache.Therefore  , the MESUR project uses a combination of a relational database to store and query item e.g. However  , their scalability and retrieval efficiency are generally not on a par with the most competitive relational database products .OntologyX uses context classes as the " glue " for relating other classes  , an approach that was adopted for the MESUR ontology. The principles espoused by the OntologyX 5 ontology are inspiring.The results of the performance for the TSA algorithm with cross correlation distance function over WS-353 are presented in Table 8. The correlation of such words  , such as " Mars " and " water " in 1900 should be weighted differently from the correlation they exhibit in 2008  , when NASA images suggested the presence of water on Mars.We employ five different document selection methodologies that are well studied in the context of evaluation  , along with the method used in LETOR for comparison purposes. If yes  , which one of these methods is better for this purpose ? "The BTC dataset contains 10 million quadruples  , but we used smaller excerpts containing 100  , 250 and 500 thousand unique quadruples. In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .Section 3 discusses initial findings in the realm of sample bias  , and Section 4 shows the first ever map of science created on the basis of a substantial scholarly usage data set. Section 2 describes the size  , origin  , and representation of the MESUR reference data set.Given both usage and bibliographic data  , it will be possible to generate and validate metrics for understanding the 'value' of all types of scholarly artifacts. The purpose of the MESUR project is to study usage behavior in the scholarly process and therefore  , usage modeling is a necessary component of the MESUR ontology.We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts. Thus  , we aimed at augmenting folksonomy-style tagging by more standard ways of assigning metadata.The two most recent contextualization shared tasks are the Word Sense Disambiguation WSD tasks of SemEval 2010 20 and SemEval 2013 23. Knowledge-free systems employ co-occurrence and distributional similarities together with language models.For reference  , we report the baseline score comparison in the following format: 3. 4 Our RankBoost baseline is comparable but different from LETOR18  , mainly due to different feature normalization mean-variance vs. 0  , 1 scaling.In the current system  , the page number of a scanned page is recognized by analyzing the OCRed text. As another example  , in case the program can not recognize the volume and issue number due to OCR error  , such as " IV " was OCRed as " it "   , the program will use the previous or the following title page information  , if available  , to construct the current volume or issue metadata.Our model outperforms all these models  , again without resorting to any feature engineering. Table 3shows the performance of our model compared to the top four models in the SemEval 2015 competition note that only the F1-score is reported by SemEval for this task and ParagraphVec.It is our understanding that any implementation of these approaches would not succeed in improving precision to any usable extent  , if at all when the experiments were based on the WT2g dataset  , due to the lack of Functional links. We didn't implement any of these approaches  , as we felt that more was to be gained from developing our own ideas  , with the knowledge that the other methods existed.Then structured queries are formed to do retrieval over different fields of documents with different weights. From those terms  , chemical entities are extracted and synonyms for the identified chemical entities are also included from PubChem.In WPBench  , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications. Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.Table 3 shows the various statistics about the datasets. The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP  , http: //snap.stanford.edu.As with our first batch of results presented for Ro- bust04  , we again assume the user provides correct feedback. Since we are only training on a single topic  , resulting accuracy is far lower than what typically published LETOR results.Since we are only training on a single topic  , resulting accuracy is far lower than what typically published LETOR results. Instead  , for each topic we train on it alone and evaluate on all other topics  , then we average this over all topics.This is a highly counterintuitive outcome. When the LETOR collection was built  , the fact that documents with low BM25 score were selected only if they were relevant resulted in BM25 being negatively correlated with relevance in the LETOR collection.Then  , for every query the system should return a ranking such that the most appropriate search engines are ranked highest without using the actual results for the given query which were  , in fact  , provided after the submission deadline of this task. The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.1 Crawled during February/March 2009  , it comprises about 1.14 billion RDF statements. The data collection we use is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.The assessors checked the number of relevant documents in the Web collection once they had a candidate topic from searching the ad hoc collection. NIST assessors referred to the WT2g collection during the process of ad hoc topic generation.Such query-independent factors are orthogonal to our approach  , so combination of the two could probably further improve the performance. The good performance of their runs largely depends on a queryindependent prior ranking of the resources learned on the results from FedWeb 2013.Thus  , the results reported here refer to non-normalized data. We also tried different strategies to normalize our feature vectors  , including L2-norm  , z-score and the LETOR normalization procedure 17  , with no improvements.In both experimental setups  , i.e.  , the LETOR and WSDM setup  , both BARACO and MT have good performance in most cases and high agreement with the ground truth. The estimated difference between rankers is strongly correlated with the ground truth in the WSDM dataset  , suggesting that both methods can estimate the difference between rankers well given the logged user interactions with the production ranker.We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads. The test queries include output tests  , selections  , joins  , projections  , aggregates  , and updates.Its responsiveness performance is closer to users' perception than any of other benchmarks. Since the Web content  , user interactions  , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers  , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers.Meanwhile  , we collected tags and brief introductions from DouBan in order to evaluate the coverage performance of our system. After filtering by Syntactic Filter  , this collection contained 10 authors  , 48 books  , 757 reviews and 13 ,606 distinct words.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method  , we performed a systematic set of experiments using the LETOR benchmark collections OHSUMED  , TD2004  , and TD2003 and several evaluation measures MAP  , NDCG and precision . This information may turn the generated rules more discriminative and accurate.In the experiment we used data obtained from a commercial search engine. Note that we did not use the public LETOR data 15  , because the numbers of queries in the datasets are too small to conduct meaningful experiments on query dependent ranking.Finally  , we discuss a pervasive pattern exhibited in all of our datasets: recency  , the tendency for more recently-consumed items to be reconsumed than items consumed further in the past. Recency is clearly present in MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE  , and absent from SHAKESPEARE and YES.At the time when were crawling Douban web site November 2009  , there were more than 700 groups under the " Movie " subcategory. Users on Douban can join different interesting groups.Table 1summarizes the properties of these data sets. For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 24 and the recently published MSLR-WEB10K data set from Microsoft Research 1.To compute these metrics we used the standard evaluation tool available for the LETOR 3.0 benchmark for binary datasets  , as well the tool available for the Microsoft dataset for all multi-label relevance judgment datasets 5 . The statistical tests are computed over the values for Mean Average Precision MAP and the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at the top 10 retrieved documents hereafter   , NDCG@10  , the two most important and frequently used performance metrics to evaluate a given permutation of a ranked list using binary and multi-relevance order 31.The number of positive and negative tweets of these datasets is given in Table 5Table 5: Message-level polarity classification datasets. The evaluation is done on three collections of tweets that were manually annotated to positive and negative classes: 6Hu- manCoded 5   , Sanders 6   , and SemEval 7 .Section 5 evaluates SERT with application benchmarks from Ask.com. Section 4 describes our implementation.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection. This test collection consists of sampled search results from 149 web search engines crawled between April and May 2014.We conduct experiments on eight standard collections  , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100  , AP88-90 with queries 51-150  , FBIS with queries 351-450  , FT91-94 with queries 301-400  , LA with queries 301-400  , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150  , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450. The number of topics Kt is set to be 400 as recommended in 15.Once the best feature set is established  , we are going to evaluate our contextualization on the SemEval 2010 20 and SemEval 2013 23 datasets. The TWSI dataset is mostly used for parameter tuning and determining the best feature configuration.Finally  , generated metadata information and OCRed text are integrated to support navigation and retrieval of content within scanned volumes. After the scanning and text recognition process  , the metadata generation system generates metadata describing the internal structure of the scanned volume and published articles contained within the volume.On SemSearch ES  , ListSearch and INEX-LD  , where the queries are keyword queries like 'Charles Darwin'  , LeToR methods show significant improvements over FSDM. The overall improvements on all queries can be as large as 8%.The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014. Though classification of resources into verticals was available  , our system did not make use of them.Runs are ordered by decreasing CF-IDF score. nDCG@20  nDCG@10  nP@1  nP@5  uiucGSLISf2 0Figure 1: Per-topic nDCG@20 and nDCG@10 for both FedWeb RS runs.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried  , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion. There are also features taken from the query that are independent from documents  , including query length  , the average  , minimum  , maximum of the collection frequencies of the query terms.Although different results are obtained for SEMEVAL and ODP- 239  , steady results are obtained for WEBSRC401 by the Dual C- Means configured with the S T S word-word similarity metric. In particular  , it tends to give high results when the other metrics decrease. The DjVu XML file retains the bounding box information of every single OCRed word  , from which we can estimate format features. Figure 3shows logical structure and bounding box information embedded within a DjVu XML document.Based on the results shown in section 5.1 we used the 5 uncorrelated measures Russell-Rao  , Yule  , Forbes  , Simpson and Manhattan for calculating the similarity values. For the user study  , we have randomly chosen 10 query entities from PubChem  , each of them representing one feedback cycle inside the system.In the Shop.com dataset  , however  , we have both the product price information and the quantity that a consumer purchased in each record. We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation  , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction   , which is absent in many of the public datasets.Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset  , we had to take this possibility into account. Regardless of the topic in question these sites would be ranked highest due to the number of inLinks associated with them.In order to avoid clutter  , only a representative subset of baselines is shown  , including the best and the worst of them. Figure 3b compares FITC-Rank with the LETOR base- lines 9 .Some users are interested in highly unstructured text data OCRed from field journals  , or more conventional relational tables of data  , so BigSur does not require that these super-classes are used. This section of the schema is not mandatory.This latter question is a matter of some interest  , as the MAP scores for LETOR 3 approach the 65% considered achievable with human-adjudicated relevance 5. So the meta-learner constitutes the best known method  , and the result raises the lower bound of what is known to be learnable from the dataset.Feature examples include TF  , IDF  , LMIR and BM25 considering  , result title  , abstract  , body  , url and pagerank values. The training features are the ones used in LETOR benchmark 2 and are described in 2.RDF 15 triple databases are the natural habitat for data represented in this manner  , and they provide great flexibility for data analysis without the need for extensive upfront application design. This ontology forms the basis for the representation of the reference data set in the MESUR infrastructure.In addition   , we also introduce our failed attempt of using topic models to perform query expansion to capture documents of multiple topics in section 5  , and a brief reflection on why this approach did not work. In the rest of this paper  , we will introduce the general pipeline of our retrieval system in Section 2  , followed by an introduction to novel Language Modelling approaches in Section 3 that were used to generate features  , and later in Section 4 we introduce all other features and the LETOR algorithms.P2 explicitly stated that while he did publish results based on quantitative methods in the past  , he would not use the same methods again due to the potential of technology-induced bias. We asked P1  , P2 and P4 about the possibilities of more quantitative tools on top of the current digital archive  , and in all cases the interviewees' response was that no matter what tools were added by the archive  , they were unlikely to trust any quantitative results derived from processing erroneous OCRed text.ChemXSeer relies on a highly complex process extracting chemical formulas in an automated way out of 150000 RSC publications and links them to the documents 1  , 2. Prime examples are the substance database PubChem 1 combining several chemical entity data sources and the document search engine ChemXSeer 2 .Table 8shows the results of all of the single-pass retrieval methods on three collections. Table 7: Optimal hyper-parameter on all retrieval methods over both types of verbose queries tuned for MAP on WT2g.In the scholarly community  , while articles  , journals  , conference proceedings  , and the like are well documented and represented in formats that lend themselves to analysis  , other information  , such as usage data  , tends to be less explicit due to the inherent privacy issues surrounding individual usage behavior. Thus  , the MESUR ontology is constrained to bibliographic and usage data since these are the primary sources of scholarly data.To do our first experiment  , we took a random 1‰ sample of the PubChem database resulting in around 48.000 chemical entities. Therefore  , we computed for each combination of fingerprint  , chemical entity and top-x the 16 fingerprint based similarity measures resulting in around 88 million similarity values.TSA results shown in the table are computed using cross correlation with a quadratic weighted function as the distance metric between single time series. The comparison results of TSA on the WS-353 dataset are reported in Table 1.In our work  , a digitized volume corresponds to a collection of objects  , including scanned images of pages  , OCRed text  , manually-generated metadata  , among others. The system detects various types of structural information  , including sentence boundaries  , filler words  , and disfluencies  , within speech transcripts using lexical  , prosodic  , and syntactic features.The Ionosphere Database consists of 351 instances with 34 numeric attributes and contains 2 classes  , which come from a classiication of radar returns from the ionosphere . We used the Ionosphere Database and the Spambase Database.In calculation of MAP  , we viewed 'definitely' and 'partially relevant' as relevant. Figure 4shows the results on Letor OHSUMED dataset in terms of MAP and NDCG  , averaged over five trials.They concluded that CORI  , and a modified version of the CORI algorithm  , performed reasonably effectively at the server selection task. 5 evaluated CORI  , vGlOSS  , and CVV in a testbed based on the 2GB  , 956 server WT2g crawl of the Web.The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines. Besides  , since each snippet has both a title and a description  , we tested considering only the title field to match the query  , only the description field desc  , or both.On the DOUBAN network  , the four algorithms achieve comparable influence spread. Here we only give the results under the WIC model.In the hundred relation most of the attributes have exactly 100 unique AS3AP benchmark: the storage organization of the relation and the selectivity factor of the query. In the uniques relation all attributes have unique values.We conduced 5-fold cross validation experiments  , using the partitions in LETOR. The idea is similar to that of sitemap based relevance propagation 24.TS task's queries are one or two sentences long  , which show research demanding of companies or experts. Therefore  , we integrated the professional chemical information from the suggested website ChemID plus 5 and PubChem 6 in our Algorithm 1.Our study design was driven by several features that we discovered in this massive corpus. For scanned articles  , per-article metadata such as titles  , issue dates  , and boundaries between articles are also derived algorithmically from the OCRed data  , rather than manually curated.Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites  , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website  , shop.com  , for our experiments. The method is denoted as SV Dmatrix.These interactions are emulated during benchmarking browsers by instrumented JavaScript which is independent of Web browsers. In WPBench  , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.In shop.com dataset  , the short-head 20% involves 0.814% of popular products. The 80:20 rule 7  is commonly used to divide between long-tail products and popular ones.This means  , for example  , that if the PageRank feature is important for the current query  , there is a good chance it will be important for other queries as well. With LETOR  , in contrast  , features capture general properties of query-document compatibility .Table 1summarizes the performance of all models when different datasets are used. In the same way  , we set latent dimensionality to 30 for Douban data α f = 0.005  , αc = 0.00005  , λ1 = 0.01  , λ2 = 0.0001  , and 35 for Douban music data α f = 0.005  , αc = 0.00005  , λ1 = 0.04  , λ2 = 0.0001.The Blog06 test collection includes a crawl of feeds XML  , associated permalinks HTML  , retrieval units  , and homepages during Dec 2005 through early 2006. 50 test topics  , each consisting of title phrase  , description sentence  , and narrative paragraph fields  , were constructed using queries from commercial blog search engines e.g.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.The user-related contexts include the number of friends  , the number of " wish 6 " issued and the number of ratings provided; the book-related contexts include the number of " wish " received and the number of ratings got. 2 Douban 5 book data 16  , which records 1 ,097 ,148 ratings from 33 ,523 users on 381 ,767 books.The performance of runs is measured by the nDCG@20  , which is the main evaluation metric used at the FedWeb research selection task. The " engines " column shows the results of the runs generated using the big-document strategy; " search " column is about all the runs generated by the snippetbased big-document strategy; and " docs " column presents the results of the runs generated by the small-document strategy.However  , since the MESUR usage data doesn't identify individual users  , usage co-occurrence was reformulated in terms of sessions  , indi-cated by anonymized session identifiers: the degree of relationship between any pair of journals is a function of the frequency by which they are jointly accessed within user ses- sions. This relationship is known as usage co-occurrence  , and it is used to create MESUR's journal usage networks.MAP is then computed by averaging AP over all queries. All presented NDCG  , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website.Snippets contain document title  , description  , and thumbnail image when available. The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.These data could be used by the participants to build resource descriptions. The FedWeb 2013 collection contains search result pages for many other queries  , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.The results provide evidence for the need to weigh the recent changes in time series distance measurement higher than the ancient changes. The results of the performance for the TSA algorithm with cross correlation distance function over WS-353 are presented in Table 8.Unfortunately  , again  , the Ingenta ontology does not support expressing usage of scholarly documents  , which is a primary concern in MESUR. An interesting ontology-based approach was developed by the Ingenta MetaStore project 19.Similarly  , a digital document may exist in different media types  , such as plain text  , HTML  , I&TEX  , DVI  , postscript  , scanned-image  , OCRed text  , or certain PC-a.pplication format. Note that  , however  , indirection duplicates are not possible with technical reports.The Web Data Commons project extracts all Microformat  , Microdata and RDFa data from the Common Crawl Web corpus  , the largest and most up-to-data Web corpus that is currently available to the public  , and provides the extracted data for download in the form of RDF-quads and also in the form of CSV-tables for common entity types e.g.  , products  , organizations  , locations  , etc. The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was crawled based on datasets provided by Falcon-S  , Sindice  , Swoogle  , SWSE  , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.Douban.com provide a community service  , which is called " Douban Group " . As another result  , Douban.com can also help one to find other users with similar tastes and interests  , so they can get connected and communicate with each other.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset. Also  , they have to be located in the Semantic Web.This may explain the relatively small absolute improvement of tLSA over LSA. However  , the words in the WS-353 dataset are relatively common  , and primarily related to static concepts  , such as " car " and " love " .The match between geolocation and language improves when we compare location breakdown with the language breakdown for blogs collected by BlogPulse in October 2006. In particular  , our projections suggest that Chinese and Russian should appear prominently in the language based segmentation.The negative correlation in the informational setting of NP2003 dataset is due to a heavily skewed distribution of candidate rankers when the production ranker is at a Figure 4: The ROC curves for BARACO and MT  , using DBN for generation and interpretation  , TD2004 dataset  , informational user model LETOR evaluation. These results show that BARACO again outperforms the EM-based method.BrightKite was a location-based social networking website where users could check in to physical locations. BRIGHTKITE.Rare exceptions like the new Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.The Web Data Commons project extracts all Microformat  , Microdata and RDFa data from the Common Crawl Web corpus and provides the extracted data for download in the form of RDF-quads or CSV-tables for common entity types e.g.  , products  , organizations   , locations  , etc. The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S  , Sindice  , Swoogle  , SWSE  , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.The results show our advanced Skipgram model is promising and superior. After that  , we design the experiments on the SemEval 2013 and 2014 data sets.Wilks manually disambiguated all occurrences of the word 'bank' within LDOCE according to the senses of its definition and compared this to the results of the cosine correlation. The occurrences of the defined word in all sentences whose vectors have the greatest similarity to the vector for a given sense are then assigned that sense7.As shown in Figure 2  , the documents selected by the two methods also exhibit very high similarity to each other. Both hedge and LETOR-like document selection methodology   , by design  , select as many relevant documents as possible .All the rest are long-tail prod- ucts. In shop.com dataset  , the short-head 20% involves 0.814% of popular products.Overall  , these results are encouraging and preliminary at the same time. In Subtask E of the SemEval 2016 Task 4 shared task a subtask which deals with ordinal tweet quantification by sentiment – see 8   , the system described in this paper obtained an EM D score of 0.243  , ranking 1st in a set of 10 participating systems  , with a high margin over the other ones systems from rank 2 to rank 8 obtained EM D scores between 0.316 and 0.366.Secondly  , in the Douban friend community  , we obtain totally different trends. 2.We use the 5-fold cross validation partitioning from LETOR 10. The optimal parameters for the final GBRT model are picked using cross validation for each data set.article metadata  , and a triple database 4 to store and query semantic relationships among items. Therefore  , the MESUR project uses a combination of a relational database to store and query item e.g.Table 11shows the accuracy of FACTO. The result pages of Ask.com with fact answers can be accessed at http://lepton.research.microsoft.com/facto/doc/ask_answer.zip.In comparison with their original publication   , the FedWeb submission assumed that all resources are of the same size. As these were not available  , document samples were used instead.BrightKite is a now defunct location-based social networking website www.brightkite.com where users could publicly check-in to various locations. BRIGHTKITE.For comparative purposes  , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure  , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO! Similarly to the WEB10K benchmark  , these datasets are partitioned into 5 folds to be used in a folded cross-validation procedure.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR  , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file. Our intuition is that rank lists generated by point-wise methods are better at the top potions  , but the precision drops quickly if we go further down the list  , as they are prone to over-fit to certain features that are most dominating.50 test topics  , each consisting of title phrase  , description sentence  , and narrative paragraph fields  , were constructed using queries from commercial blog search engines e.g.  , BlogPulse and Technorati. Among the blog document set 100 ,649 feeds 38GB  , 2.8 million permalinks 75GB  , and 325 ,000 homepages 20GB  , only the permalinks were used in our experiment.Figure 1: Overview of MESUR project phases. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs. Opinion modules require opinion lexicons  , which are extracted from training data.We then combine page features and line features for volume level and issue level metadata generation. During the parsing of the XML file  , the system calculates features for every word  , line  , paragraph  , and page of the OCRed text.An exception was BROOF gradient which converged at about 100 iterations for the largest datasets. On average  , our strategies converge at about 15 iterations on the LETOR datasets  , and around 5 to 10 iterations on the multi-relevance judgment datasets.For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 24 and the recently published MSLR-WEB10K data set from Microsoft Research 1. All three data sets are pre–folded and come with evaluation scripts that allow fair comparison of different ranking algorithms.Another significant component of the MESUR project is the development of a scholarly ontology that represents bibliographic  , citation  , usage concepts  , along with concepts for expressing different artifact metrics. The project includes efforts to define provenance XML schemas  , algorithms for uncertainty quantification  , and a novel semantic query model that leverages both relational and triple store databases.We validate TermPicker's recommendation quality by performing one evaluation on the DyLDO 21 9 dataset and a second evaluation on the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2014 dataset 22 10 crawl no. in the following way: the first two recommendations are irrelevant  , and the first relevant recommendation is at the third rank of the result list.The goal of our workflow is to generate enriched index pages for all documents within the collection. The most comprehensive open access database for the area of chemistry is PubChem 14 .Although we felt that the 100GB collection would be more useful as a research tool  , we didn't have the storage capacity available to handle such a large dataset at that time. Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset  , consisting of 247 ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.Because only the most popular tags are listed for the books in DouBan  , we obtained merely 135 distinct tags. Meanwhile  , we collected tags and brief introductions from DouBan in order to evaluate the coverage performance of our system.Table 3shows the performance of our model compared to the top four models in the SemEval 2015 competition note that only the F1-score is reported by SemEval for this task and ParagraphVec. The performance is measured as the average F1-score of the positive and the negative class.Figure 3below shows the precision at 5 -1000 documents returned from running the modified queries on WT2g. We hope that the 10GB dataset next year will contain a higher percentage of Functional links.This article presents  , the OWL ontology 17 used by MESUR to represent bibliographic  , citation and usage data in an integrated manner. Mining such a vast data set in an efficient  , performing  , and flexible manner presents significant challenges regarding data representation and data access.Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible  , without using any external processing engine or resources  , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit. How to optimize towards diversity under the context LETOR is yet another problem to be studied in future.Since the first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine website we could not obtain any click data that can validate which uncommented stories were actually viewed by a user. As shown in Table 2  , this dataset contains 25 ,527 articles with 1 ,664 ,917 comments and 320 ,425 users.These preliminary results already provide a tantalizing preview of the possibility of usage-based metrics of impact that are more adaptive  , more timely and more accurate than any other assessment metric that is presently available. This result strongly suggests that usage-based impact rankings may further converge as MESUR ingests its entire collection of 1 billion usage events  , but that this convergence may very well be towards a notion of scholarly prestige different than the one expressed by the IF.The features of Letor TD2003 and TD2004 datasets include low-level features such as term frequency tf  , inverse document frequency idf  , and document length dl  , as well as high-level features such as BM25  , LMIR  , PageRank  , and HITS. Each query document pair is given a binary judgment: relevant or irrelevant.Each user can provide ratings ranging from one star to five stars to books  , movies and music  , indicating his/her preference on the item. Douban 7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books  , movies and music.Along with novel models of scholarly evaluation  , advances in semantic network analysis algorithms and large-scale data management techniques have and will continue to be produced. Furthermore  , the MESUR project aims to contribute to the study of large-scale semantic networks.Recency is clearly present in MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE  , and absent from SHAKESPEARE and YES. iii SHAKESPEARE iv YES Figure 6: Normalized hit ratio as a function of cache size for four different datasets.which is a global quantity but measured locally. After excluding splogs from the BlogPulse data  , weWe also tried different strategies to normalize our feature vectors  , including L2-norm  , z-score and the LETOR normalization procedure 17  , with no improvements. Using cross-validation in V  , we also varied cost j between 10 −3 and 10 3   , finding that the best choice was j=100  , in most cases.For WebKB dataset we learnt 10 topics. For SRAA dataset we learnt 10 topics on the complete dataset and labeled these 10 topics for all the three classification tasks.In Ranking SVM plus relation  , we make use of both content information and relation information. Actually  , the results of Ranking SVM are already provided in LETOR.This paper has described preliminary results derived from an analysis of a subset of the MESUR reference data set that consists of over 200 million article-level usage events. This reference data set forms the basis for a program aimed at the identification  , validation and characterization of a range of usage-based metrics.Clearly  , the recency only model is the second best and the improvements by the hybrid model over the recency model are significant for MAPCLICKS and BRIGHTKITE. For computational efficiency reasons  , we learn recency weights over the previous 200 positions only.Nevertheless  , we have adapted the AS3AP benchmark to fit into our purposes. AS3AP is the ANSI SQL Standard Scaleable and Portable Benchmark for comparing relational DBMSs.One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users. We made best effort in choosing representative and real-life experimental subjects.Thus  , we find English  , Chinese and Russian languages to be strongly represented as the location segmentation implies. This is not surprising  , as the BlogPulse blog data was used as a source set of blog urls for harvesting blog author profiles.Furthermore  , the Newsvine friendship relations are publicly crawlable. As mentioned in Section 4  , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.It turned out that ruling out terms Figure 1 : MAP and P@10 for short queries at different pruning levels  , baseline and different settings WT2g collection   , as those terms have a negative score for every document.For each query and document  , we extract about three hundred of features in the experiment  , where the features are similar to those defined in LETOR16. We follow the RankNet 5 method which is a pairwise ranking algorithm receiving the pairwise preferences to optimize the ranking function.Section 6 summarizes related work. Section 5 evaluates SERT with application benchmarks from Ask.com.By performing all knowledge graphrelated work in the Semantic Document Expansion preprocessing step  , we also achieve a highly scalable solution. We even achieve superior performance for very short documents 6–8 words in the SemEval task as long as we can link to at least one entity.ask.com before query " Ask Jeeves " . However  , the vlHMM notices that the user input query " ask.com " and clicked www.Both hedge and LETOR-like document selection methodology   , by design  , select as many relevant documents as possible . Furthermore   , when relevant and non-relevant documents in the training data set are very similar to each other  , performance of the resulting ranking functions decline.BM25 instead of the TF·IDF; – the use of external evidence to obtain a more effective information need representation. by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available  , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level  , e.g.The tiny relation is a one column  , one tuple relation used to measure overhead. The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations.We also showed an application of the proposed method in an online ad serving system for matching and ranking ads for a given Web page which indicates the applicability of the proposed algorithm in real online applications as we improved the CTR and RPM significantly in the online bucket tests. Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.Subsets of documents are chosen according to the six methods at different percentages of the complete document collection in our case the depth-100 pool  , and features are extracted from the selected query-document pairs. We employ five different document selection methodologies that are well studied in the context of evaluation  , along with the method used in LETOR for comparison purposes.We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year. Section 3 shows combination of the basic methods for different runs and the results will also be introduced.We conducted 5-fold cross validation experiments  , following the guideline of Letor. In total  , there are 44 features.We used synonyms from PubChem for chemicals that have been identified  , used simple entity recognition to extract information that is later used to increment or decrement weights of some terms and to filter out documents from the ranked list. of patents and documents in a weighted way.Thus  , for each theme  , sentences have a representation that depends on the theme while the associated relevance judgment depends on the topic in hand. By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme  , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets 6 as well as a feature produced by a bigram language model proposed in the top performing system at DUC 2006 4.The document collection is a subset of MEDLINE  , a database on medical publications. The OHSUMED data set in LETOR has been derived from the OHSUMED benchmark data 16 for information retrieval research.The result pages of Ask.com with fact answers can be accessed at http://lepton.research.microsoft.com/facto/doc/ask_answer.zip. For example  , for query {raven symone gives birth} it answers " Raven-Symoné is not and has never been pregnant according to reports "   , which shows it knows what has not happened besides what has.Accordingly   , let IDCGp be the maximum possible discounted cumulative gain for a given query. We chose to standardize this issue  , using the same criterion used by most evaluation tools  , e.g.  , those available for the Letor 3.0 and 4.0 and Microsoft datasets  , in order to allow fairer comparisons.More in particular  , only results from the top 20 highest ranked resources in the selection run were allowed in the merging run. An important new condition in the Results Merging task  , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task  , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.The most common indicator of journal status is Thomson Scientific's journal Impact Factor IF that is published every year for a set of about 8 ,000 selected journals. 7 The MESUR website offers detailed information on metric definitions and abbreviations: http://www.mesur.org/The first author is also supported under a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship. This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation  , under NSF grant IIS-0329090  , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.On all evaluation metrics the ranking perceptron achieves scores comparable to SVM on the OHSUMED and TD2003 datasets  , and comparable to RankBoost on TD2004. However  , to get an estimate for the accuracy of the methods we implemented  , we evaluated the ranking perceptron see Section 3  , on the Letor dataset 21.The configuration can determine the replay policies  , such as whether to emulate the networking latencies. In the replaying stage  , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet.For example in Ask.com search site  , some uncached requests may take over one second but such a query will be answered quickly next time from a result cache. meet the soft deadline.The MESUR project attempts to fundamentally increase our understanding of usage data. Indeed  , most existing research into usage-based metrics of scholarly impact focuses on single metrics whose characteristics are explored on the basis of usage data that has been recorded for particular scholarly communities.An interesting ontology-based approach was developed by the Ingenta MetaStore project 19. use  , it is designed at a level of generality that does not directly support the granularity required by the MESUR project.After filtering by Syntactic Filter  , this collection contained 10 authors  , 48 books  , 757 reviews and 13 ,606 distinct words. Without existing benchmark dataset  , we used Review Spider to collect reviews from a Chinese website DouBan to form our experiment dataset.Citation data are routinely used to assess the impact of journals  , journal articles  , scholarly authors  , and the institutions these authors are affiliated with. Creating a reference data set: MESUR has invested significant energy to compile a large-scale col- 1 Pronounced " measure "   , an acronym for " Metrics from Scholarly Usage of Resources " .Elastic Block Storage EBS volumes of 350G were allocated for each compute instance to accommodate the size of the index and the need to insure persistence of the database if a compute instance was restarted. Each database shard included a dimensional data model for its portion of the collection  , and a dimensional index of PubChem 8 terminology for synonym identification.1 The analysis consisted of gathering classifications from different human annotators and from different IR / text mining methods and semantic resources  , and of quantitative and qualitative analyses of their outputs. This paper addresses these questions by an empirical analysis that uses a part of a standard blog corpus: the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006.In both datasets TSA significantly outperformed the baselines. The results using the WS-353 and Mturk dataset can be seen in Table 3.We make the new dataset publicly available for further research in the field. In contrast with the previous standard benchmark  , WS-353  , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below  , which eliminates subjective selection of words.We first fix the iteration number to 10  , and show MAE and RMSE with varying dimensionality of latent factor vector see Fig.2SoReg is slightly better than RPMF indicates that carefully processed social network information contributes more to a recommendation model at least on the Douban dataset. Before comparison  , we determine two important parameters  , i.e.  , latent factor vector dimensionality and the number of iterations for matrix factorization based models.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was crawled based on datasets provided by Falcon-S  , Sindice  , Swoogle  , SWSE  , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework. They represent two very different kinds of RDF data.So far  , MESUR reached agreements for the exchange of usage data with 14 parties  , and as a result has compiled a data set covering over 1 billion article-level usage events  , as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data. As a result  , it is possible to extract the various articles that users requested a service for in the course of a given session   , and to reconstruct the clickstream of these users in the information system that recorded the usage data.This poster provides an overview of the MESUR project's workplan and architecture  , and will show preliminary results relating to the characterization of its semantic network and a range of usage-based impact metrics. The final project outcome will be the publication of guidelines with regards to the properties of various usage-based impact metrics  , and how they can be appropriately applied.Our empirical study reports that there are altogether 16 ,385 cell arrays among 993 out of 4 ,037 spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus 11. In this paper  , we focus only on those cell arrays subject to computational semantics expressed in formula patterns without using " if " conditions.According to this methodology  , documents in the complete collection are first ranked by their BM25 scores for each query and the top-k documents are then selected for feature extraction.  LETOR: For comparison purposes  , a LETOR-like document selection methodology is also employed.For datasets  , we used MQ2007 and MQ2008  , a collection of benchmarks released in 2009 by Microsoft Research Asia research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/beijing/projects/letor/. The depth of the complete solution is d = 8.As a result  , the NDCG-Annealing algorithm is more stable and pronounced compared to the baselines in LETOR 3.0 dataset. We also see from Figure 4 that our NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms all the other baseline algorithms on this dataset.Douban is a Chinese Web 2.0 Web site providing user rating   , review and recommendation services for movies  , books and music. We use the Douban 3 dataset in this subsection since in addition to the user-item rating matrix  , it also contains a social friend network between users.Note that  , this pre-defined hard categorization can also be used to improve ranking by applying the same method in Section 3.3. The statistics of queries for three categories in LETOR 3.0 can be found in 16.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation  , under NSF grant IIS-0329090  , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770. We would like to thank Scott Hudson  , James Fogarty  , Elsabeth Golden  , Santosh Mathan  , and Karen Tang for helping with the experiment design and execution  , and we also thank the study participants for their efforts.The results of the state-ofthe-art algorithms are provided in the LETOR 3.0. In LETOR 3.0 package  , each dataset is partitioned into five for five-fold cross validation and each fold includes training   , testing and validation sets.It is also the largest online book  , movie and music database and one of the largest online communities in China. Douban  , launched on March 6  , 2005  , is a Chinese Web 2.0 web site providing user rating  , review and recommendation services for movies  , books and music.However  , the mean is a poor statistic to describe the power-law distributions of links on the web; average linkage is dominated by the many pages with few links and gives little insight into the topology. They concluded that linkage in WT2g was inadequate for web experiments.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches. Search engines typically record the search strings entered by users and some search sites even make the history of past searches available to the user.The first evaluation is based on the LETOR datasets 17  , which include manual relevance assessments. The rankers are compared using the metric rrMetric 3.This ontology forms the basis for the representation of the reference data set in the MESUR infrastructure. The requirement to handle a variety of semantic relationships publishes  , cites  , uses and different types of content bibliographic data  , citation data  , usage data  , led MESUR to define a context-centric OWL ontology that models the scholarly communication process 19 3 .Unfortunately  , the LDA based topic mining approach has failed in this task. And we hopped to be able to generate weighted distribution of words that could potentially identify multiple topics of a query from the top ranked documents  , and by using these approximations of multiples topics  , we can perform multiple searches for the same query with different expansions  , followed by separate LETOR for each expanded query  , and eventually merge the results with data fusion.The Merriam-Webster and Longman dictionaries offered different capabilities as repositories of data about lexical concepts. Three of the most accessible were the Merriam-Webster Pock& Dictionary MPD  , its larger sibling  , the Merriam-Webster Seventh Colegiate ~7 and the Longman Di@ionary of Contemporary English LDOCE.In BlogPulse  , according to the splog detection methodology presented in 14  , the percentage of splogs is 7.48%. Some previous work has identified a certain fraction of splogs in these two datasets.With both the ESA index and the proposed selectioncentric context language model pw|s  , c  , we can compute a selection-centric context semantic vector Vs  , c based on the centroid of the semantic vector of each term. To assess the quality of our ESA index   , we apply it to compute word relatedness on the widelyaccepted WS-353 benchmark dataset 12  , which contains 353 word pairs  , and our experiments show a Spearman's rank correlation of 0.735  , which is consistent to the previously reported numbers 16  , 17.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 . We proceed to describe how each of the datasets was obtained and preprocessed.We also introduced an algorithm using the collection's information in prior art task for keyword selection. For technology survey  , we proposed a chemical terminology expansion algorithm with the professional chemical domain information from two chemical websites  , ChemID plus and PubChem.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of Linear Ranking SVM. For all the SVM models in the experiment  , we employed Linear SVM.We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com. Applying our utility function to SVD leads to a new utility function SV D util in this paper.This dataset contains the purchase history from 2004-01-01 to 2009-03-08. Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites  , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website  , shop.com  , for our experiments.The MESUR ontology provides three subclasses of owl:Thing. The most general class in OWL is owl:Thing.For our evaluation we used a dump of the PubChem database 4 containing around 31.5 million chemical entities. For each of these documents we extracted the chemical entities and their roles within a reaction.Douban  , launched on March 6  , 2005  , is a Chinese Web 2.0 web site providing user rating  , review and recommendation services for movies  , books and music. The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.From the work of Kleinberg in 7  , it is generally accepted that for queries on broad topics  , Connectivity Analysis will allow for the selection of the most popular densely linked documents from within a WWW community in response to a query  , in addition to automatic result clustering. We do suggest caution being taken when reviewing the Small Web Task to take the results in the context of the WT2g dataset  , lest one conclude that Connectivity Analysis does not improve precision in any case.It aims to pave the way for an inclusion of usage-based metrics into the toolset used for the assessment of scholarly impact and move the domain beyond the longestablished and often disputed IF. The MESUR project attempts to fundamentally increase our understanding of usage data.The best results in Table 2are highlighted in bold. Table 2summarizes the total performance of BCDRW and BASIC methods in terms of precision and coverage on the aforementioned DouBan data set.The performance is measured as the average F1-score of the positive and the negative class. Even though there are three classes  , the SemEval task is a binary task.The results of RankSVM  , RankBoost  , AdaRank and FRank are reported in the Letor data set. For AdaRank  , we use the version for optimizing the mean average precision for comparison in this study.We are not surprised that our systems did not work well on diversity metrics as shown in Table 3  , because the diversity module of our system was not functioning as we expected and eventually we chose to not to include it in our pipeline. This also suggests that our LETOR framework is effective in improving the overall precision.The BTC data set has been crawled from the web in a typical web spider fashion and contains about 1.44 billion triples. For our empirical analysis  , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.Six collections  , relevant to the assignment about television and film personalities  , from various archives were indexed: 1 a television program collection containing 0.5M metadata records; 2 a photo collection with 20K photos of people working at television studio; 3 a wiki dedicated to actors and presenters 20K pages; 4 25K television guides that are scanned and OCRed; 5 scanned and OCRed newspapers between 1900 and 1995 6M articles; and 6 digital newspapers between 1995 and 2010 1M articles. Collections.We have implemented a contextualization system that we are now extending with new features for a publication in the near future. Using large language model with and word co-occurrences  , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013  , task 13 23.As a result  , in order to improve triple store query efficiency  , MESUR stores such data in a relational database  , and the MESUR ontology does not explicitly represent these literals. in the triple store  , as done by Ingenta  , is not essential.Future work will present benchmark results of the MESUR triple store. While a trim ontology has been presented  , the effects of this ontology on load and query times is still inconclusive.P -perfect user model setting  , I -informational  , N -navigational LETOR eval- uation. The error bars are standard errors of the means.In the replaying stage  , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet. Our benchmark meets all the aforementioned requirements.The motivation in this case was to find queries of a similar type e.g.  , navigational or information queries  , but no improvements were observed with smaller training sets such as Letor. There have been some attempts to do this 1  , 4.To pre-train the weights of our network  , we use a large unsupervised corpus containing 50M tweets for training the word embeddings and a 10M tweet corpus for distant supervision. For evaluation we use the official scorers from Semeval 2015  , which compute the average between F-measures for the positive and negative classes.A significant amount of data processing must be performed to turn the heterogeneous usage data collections obtained from a variety of sources into a reference data set that provides a solid basis to perform cross-source analysis: 1. In certain cases  , the usage data is provided by the source in an anonymized form  , in other cases MESUR is responsible for the required processing.As presented before  , we experimented with one run based on document relevance and with three other runs depending on the output of the previous task  , that is  , a ranking of resources. On the other hand  , the boosting method is highly dependent on the ranking of the resources  , as we observe when a better resource selection method is used BM25 desc in FedWeb 2013 or the hybrid run in FedWeb 2012. The DjVu XML file presents logical structures of the OCRed text. We choose the DjVu XML 2 file as the main input of the metadata generation system for several reasons:  The DjVu XML file contains full OCRed text.Also  , data mining for high-level behavioral patterns in a diachronous  , heterogeneous  , partially- OCRed corpus of this scale is quite new  , precedented on this scale perhaps only by 8 which brands this new area as " culturomics " . We list them here to explain our study design.For brevity  , we report MAP as the measure of system performance . This latter question is a matter of some interest  , as the MAP scores for LETOR 3 approach the 65% considered achievable with human-adjudicated relevance 5.This behavior is particularly strong for the BRIGHTKITE dataset  , where cyclic behavior has been observed 10. Finally   , we observe that the time scores capture cyclic behavior in the check-in data around daily and weekly marks.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries  , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages. Participants have to rank the given 149 search engines for each test topic without having access to the corresponding search results.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications. To the best of our knowledge  , there exists no previous benchmark which can automatically emulate the process of user Web surfing in a way fair to Web browsers.Additionally   , the MPD and w7 were the result of an extensive organization effort by a whole series of computational lexicologists who had refined its format to a very easily computed structural description Reichert  , Oiney & Paris 69  , Sherman 74  , Amsler and White 79  , Peterson 82  , Peterson 871 The LDOCE while very new  , offered something relatively rare in dictionaries  , a series of syntactic and semantic codes for the meanings of its words. The MPD and w7 provided a mature collection of definitions   , and the family resemblance of the smaller MPD to the w7 and the w7 to the definitive American English dictionary  , the unabridged Merriam-Webster Third international ~31 provided the ability to find out more about definitions in any of the smaller books by consulting its " big brother " when the need arose.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents  , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data. The Disk1&2  , Disk4&5 collection contains newswire articles from various sources  , such as Association Press AP  , Wall Street Journal WSJ  , Financial Times FT  , etc.  , which are usually considered as high-quality text data with little noise.We compare the proposed context-aware biased MF with conventional biased MF and a representative context-aware model FM. The user-related and item-related contexts are the same with those used in Douban book data.We use the validation set to decide which kernels to use in the transductive system. Following LETOR convention  , each dataset is divided into 5 folds with a 3:1:1 ratio for training  , validation  , and test set.Previously  , sentiment diversification was mainly applied to controversial topics which required opinionated documents to appear in retrieval results 7. Having this in mind  , FedWeb dataset seemed appropriate for our experiments as it provides the federated environment on which we could incorporate opinions in federated search.The requirement to handle a variety of semantic relationships publishes  , cites  , uses and different types of content bibliographic data  , citation data  , usage data  , led MESUR to define a context-centric OWL ontology that models the scholarly communication process 19 3 . Unique identifiers for these items are shared among these storage infrastructures and allow jumping from one to the other as needed.Combining each time different subsets to make the training  , the validation and the test set  , the LETOR authors create 5 different arrangements for five-fold cross validation. In LETOR  , data is partitioned in five subsets.The datasets used in Semeval-2015 are summarized in Table 1. We test our model on two subtasks from Semeval-2015 Task 10: phrase-level subtask A and message-level subtask B 1 .The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S  , Sindice  , Swoogle  , SWSE  , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework. They represent two very different kinds of RDF data.This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection Nguyen et al.  , 2012. The relevance cut-off parameter N is set to 200.We chose to standardize this issue  , using the same criterion used by most evaluation tools  , e.g.  , those available for the Letor 3.0 and 4.0 and Microsoft datasets  , in order to allow fairer comparisons. assume the value of 1 for these cases  , which may lead to higher values of NDCG 2.Experimental results  , obtained using the LETOR benchmark  , indicate that methods that learn to rank at query-time outperform the state-ofthe-art methods. By generating rules on a demand-driven basis  , depending on the documents to be ranked  , only the necessary information is extracted from the training data  , resulting in fast and effective ranking methods.These data could be used by the participants to build resource descriptions . The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries  , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.There are 106 queries in the collection split into five folds. We also analyze the results of our approach on a different dataset; OHSUMED 5 which is also available in Letor 16.To focus our evaluation on string data  , we only extracted columns that contained at least 20 string cells i.e. Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category  , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.Before comparison  , we determine two important parameters  , i.e.  , latent factor vector dimensionality and the number of iterations for matrix factorization based models. Finally  , we compare the performance of SoCo with that of other recommender systems using the Douban dataset.We also applied the algorithm to rank ads with non-linear ranking function described in section 7 in contextual advertising in both online and offline scenarios. The results on seven datasets in LETOR 3.0 show that the NDCG-Annealing algorithm can outperform the baselines and it is more stable.This is represented in Figure 5where an edge denotes a rdfs:subClassOf relationship. These MESUR classes are mesur:Agent  , mesur:Document  , and mesur:Context 7 .This assumption seems to be confirmed by the pattern that emerges as the MESUR reference data set grows and becomes more diverse over time. As a result  , one can assume that substantial usage data sets must be aggregated from a variety of sources in order to derive conclusions that have global reach 3 .The results are reported for the BPR loss function  , which achieved the best results for the Newsvine dataset in accordance with the previous subsection. Table 6shows the obtained results when using the tags  , co-commenting and social signals   , compared to using only the tags and co-commenting signals.Our view is that we will eliminate whatever senses we can  , but those which we cannot distinguish or for which we have no preference  will be considered as falling into a word sense equivalence class. In the experiment in disambiguating the 197 occurrences of 'bank' within LDOCE  , Wilks found a number of cases where none of the senses was clearly 'the right one' Wilks 891.We also conducted experiments to observe the training curve of PermuRank.MAP in terms of MAP on OHSUMED. Figure 5and Figure 6show the results on the Letor TD2003 and TD2004 datasets.We compare our proposed NDCG-Annealing algorithm with those baselines provided in LETOR 3.0. As a result  , the NDCG-Annealing algorithm is more stable and pronounced compared to the baselines in LETOR 3.0 dataset.We report the results for training the network on the official supervised dataset from Semeval'15 using parameters that were initialized: i completely at random Random; ii using word embeddings from the neural language model trained on a large unsupervised dataset Unsup with the word2vec tool and iii initializing all the parameters of our model with the parameters of the network that uses the word embeddings from the previous step and are further tuned on a distant supervised dataset Distant. 3.3.For list-wise LETOR  , we are using ListNet 6  , which uses a simple one layer Neural Network with Gradient Decent to optimize a defined list-wise loss function based on " top one probability " . We expect the pairwise methods to perform better than point-wise approaches  , as the features collected from the error pairs are more meaningful as they define relative distances.IDF was calculated on the corpus of all 429 ,183 blog posts from the 4th July that were contained in the original Blogpulse corpus. a5 derives from the observation that because of the rich context of blogs  , captured for example in hyperlinked sources  , important terms may not actually be frequent in the post itself  , such that their being unusual high IDF creates a better indicator of importance 10.All presented NDCG  , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website. To compute P@k and MAP on the MQ datasets the relevance levels are binarised with 1 converted to 0 and 2 converted to 1.Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations. Our design dynamically selects termination threshold  , adaptive to load condition and performs early termination safely.The LETOR-like selection achieves both high precision and recall at small percentages of data used for training up to 5% and then it drops to the levels of statAP and depth pooling. Since infAP is based on uniform random sampling  , the precision of infAP stays constant while the recall grows linearly with the sample percentage.Figure 8 shows the results on the DOUBAN and LIVE- JOURNAL datasets. With similar running time  , IMRank2 achieves significant higher influence spread than that of PMIA and IRIE.In the case of SRAA dataset we inferred 8 topics on the training data and labeled these 8 topics for all the three classification tasks discussed above. For various subsets of the datasets discussed above  , we choose number of topics as twice the number of classes.For BRIGHTKITE  , PDP captures essentially all of the likelihood. In all cases  , personalization captures over 75% of the available likelihood.It is a good datasest for our experiments since we will be discovering patterns from features that have already been proven to work. The LETOR dataset conveniently extracts many stateof-the-art features from documents  , including BM25 22  , HITS 14  , and Language Model 34.In certain cases  , the usage data is provided by the source in an anonymized form  , in other cases MESUR is responsible for the required processing. As a result  , all usage data in the MESUR reference data set is anonymized both regarding individual and institutional identity.Since the Web content  , user interactions  , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers  , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers. These interactions are emulated during benchmarking browsers by instrumented JavaScript which is independent of Web browsers.Note that we did not use the public LETOR data 15  , because the numbers of queries in the datasets are too small to conduct meaningful experiments on query dependent ranking. All the methods tested in this section are based on the same feature set.The assessment of scholarly impact is now largely a matter of expert opinion or metrics derived from citation data  , e.g. This poster provides an overview of the MESUR project's workplan and architecture  , and will show preliminary results relating to the characterization of its semantic network and a range of usage-based impact metrics.Opinion identification is accomplished by combining the four opinion modules that leverage various evidences of opinion e.g  , Opinion Lexicon  , Opinion Collocation  , Opinion Morphology. We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.Finally  , we compare the performance of SoCo with that of other recommender systems using the Douban dataset. 8 and 9 and find that our proposed context-aware PCC reduces MAE/RMSE compared to original PCC by around 4.25%/5.46% on average book data  , movie data and music data.These codes were a fascinating repository of raw linguistic " ore " from which the possibility of additional " finds " could be made. Additionally   , the MPD and w7 were the result of an extensive organization effort by a whole series of computational lexicologists who had refined its format to a very easily computed structural description Reichert  , Oiney & Paris 69  , Sherman 74  , Amsler and White 79  , Peterson 82  , Peterson 871 The LDOCE while very new  , offered something relatively rare in dictionaries  , a series of syntactic and semantic codes for the meanings of its words.It thus took about 1.7 seconds to analyze one spreadsheet on average. Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization  , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data. The ultimate answer to this question depends on the exact data and queries used  , though based on our experimental analysis above  , we believe that an adaptive materialization strategy provides the best trade-off for running provenanceenabled queries over Web Data in general.The MESUR project will proceed according to the following project phases: 1. It will do so by creating a large-scale reference data set in the form of a semantic network that relates usage  , citation and bibliographic data at a scale that is intended to be representative of the scholarly community.There is ample research into how to reduce the error rates of OCRed text in a post-processing phase. While this makes it easier for scholars to use the archive  , it also denies them the possibility to investigate potential tool-induced bias.The principles espoused by the OntologyX 5 ontology are inspiring. As a result  , in order to improve triple store query efficiency  , MESUR stores such data in a relational database  , and the MESUR ontology does not explicitly represent these literals.Figure 6 presents the complete taxonomy of the MESUR ontology. No holonymy/meronymy composite class definitions are used at this stage of the ontology's development.Users on Douban can join different interesting groups. Hence  , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 211  , as well as 14 categories of data that we identified by logging what four administrative assistants typed into their web browsers over a 3 week period 10. To evaluate expressiveness  , we have used the TDE to implement and use topes for dozens of kinds of data.Ultimately  , the rank based resource score combined with the document score on the RS baseline provided by the FedWeb team performed the best drexelRS7mW. On the other side  , the document score was based on its reciprocal rank of the selected resource.Researching sampling bias: MESUR examines the effects of sampling biases on its reference data set to determine whether and how a usage data set can be compiled that is representative of global scholarly us- age. 2.Most QA systems are substantial team efforts  , involving the design and maintenance of question taxonomies 14  , 15  , question classifiers  , and passage-scoring heuristics. Fal- con 14  , Webclopedia 15  , Mulder 18  , AnswerBus 28 and AskMSR 11 are some well-known research systems  , as are those built at the University of Waterloo 7  , 8  , and Ask Jeeves http://ask.com.Defining and validating usage-based metrics: MESUR defines a wide range of usage-based metrics  , calculates them for the established reference data set  , and assesses their validity and reliability. 4.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links. First a connectivity server was made available on the Web.They concluded that linkage in WT2g was inadequate for web experiments. Singhal and Kaszkiel 4 looked at average in-and out-links  , within and across hosts  , between the smaller WT2g corpus and their own large crawl.This strategy is also more in line with intuition. and WT2g.To our knowledge  , we are the first paper to explicitly parallelize CART 5  tree construction for the purpose of gradient boosting. On the Microsoft LETOR data set  , we see a small decrease in accuracy  , but the speedups are even more impressive.The breakdown of usage data sources is as follows 2 : Publishers Six major international scholarly publishers. So far  , MESUR reached agreements for the exchange of usage data with 14 parties  , and as a result has compiled a data set covering over 1 billion article-level usage events  , as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data.The latter is typical in our case because the scores generate by different LETOR algorithms are different in terms of scale and rank-score curves. Many previous studies on Data fusion 17 18 19 suggested that when the scores of the systems to be combined are commensurable   , using score based fusion methods are better than using only the rank positions  , but when the scores are incompatible or if the systems generate different rank-score curves  , rank based fusion techniques are better.The feature extraction step uses OCRed text and the bounding box information to calculate line features for every text line contained within a scanned volume. There are two steps in the automatic metadata generation process: feature extraction and metadata labeling.
