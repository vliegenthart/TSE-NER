The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries  , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages. Participants have to rank the given 149 search engines for each test topic without having access to the corresponding search results.For example  , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions   , each of which is embodied by a single servlet. Given that any dynamic Web site has a finite number of interactions  , it is simple to maintain per-servlet estimates.Thus  , for each theme  , sentences have a representation that depends on the theme while the associated relevance judgment depends on the topic in hand. By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme  , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets 6 as well as a feature produced by a bigram language model proposed in the top performing system at DUC 2006 4.These are the two Wikia encyclopedias with the largest number of articles evaluated by users regarding their quality. From the Wikia service  , we selected the encyclopedias Wookieepedia  , about the Star Wars universe  , and Muppet  , about the TV series " The Muppet Show " .For example  , most of the 10 news sites  , which are used for the current GeoTopics  , have sidebars and footers in their articles  , which cause falsematching problems e.g.  , 'NASDAQ' was ranked high because it is appeared on the side bars in many of the news articles. Although the high-level processing steps are the same extracting articles  , filtering and classifying them  , and generating the HTML report  , the selection and coordination of the information management services need to be flexible and reconfigurable to handle dynamic situations.Craigslist allows users to view and post ads with very simple markup and formatting. Craigslist.ACSys made that data available in two ways. Nick Craswell developed software for extracting hyper-link connectivity information from WT2g.The new terms are processed and added to the display  , leaving the earlier portion of the query display intact. The user can also add new terms to an existing query by appending them to the original natural language query string.We are aware of the implicit bias of this selection but for simplicity it shall be sufficient. Rather than attempt to get an unbiased sample  , we randomly sampled 500 URIs from the Open Directory Project dmoz.org.In the rest of the paper  , we first present the background information on the TPC benchmark W. Then  , in Section 3  , we discuss the design of our distributed bookstore application with the focus on the four distributed objects that enable data replication for the edge services. Some consistency optimizations we exploit are similar to some proposed in previous work 25  , 26  , 32  , 36  , 42   , but our emphasis is on how to integrate these ideas and effectively apply them to make an important class of applications work.The configuration can determine the replay policies  , such as whether to emulate the networking latencies. In the replaying stage  , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet.The requirement is incorrect and the Sender is not convinced that it is correct he feels that something is wrong. However  , an intact partnership between Sender and Receiver would provide an open communication between them and prevent information hiding.For list-wise LETOR  , we are using ListNet 6  , which uses a simple one layer Neural Network with Gradient Decent to optimize a defined list-wise loss function based on " top one probability " . We expect the pairwise methods to perform better than point-wise approaches  , as the features collected from the error pairs are more meaningful as they define relative distances.When making trade-offs  , we consider the fact that technology trends reduce the cost of computer resources while making human time relatively expensive 12. Design trade-offs for our distributed TPC-W system are guided by our project goal of providing high availability and good performance for e-commerce edge services as well as by technology trends.Overall  , there are 492  , 104 communities withheld from Orkut data set one community withheld for each user. We set k to be 1001  , so that the number of random communities selected for ranking evaluation is 1000.In fact  , the extension seems more likely to increase reusability  , e.g.  , by allowing researchers to analyse their system's performance over topics that best match their intended search context. The extension proposed in this paper keeps the original test collection documents  , topics  , relevance judgments completely intact.The result pages of Ask.com with fact answers can be accessed at http://lepton.research.microsoft.com/facto/doc/ask_answer.zip. For example  , for query {raven symone gives birth} it answers " Raven-Symon√© is not and has never been pregnant according to reports "   , which shows it knows what has not happened besides what has.In our work  , a digitized volume corresponds to a collection of objects  , including scanned images of pages  , OCRed text  , manually-generated metadata  , among others. The system detects various types of structural information  , including sentence boundaries  , filler words  , and disfluencies  , within speech transcripts using lexical  , prosodic  , and syntactic features.We assigned URLs in our dataset to categories in the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org in an automated manner using a content-based classifier  , described and evaluated in 4 . We assigned topical labels to extracted URLs to identify which were medically related.To get an idea of the percentage of simple queries used on real e-commerce applications  , we examined the TPC-W benchmark which models a digital bookstore 27. However  , typical Web applications issue a majority of simple queries.Since OpenStreetMap is a prominent example of volunteered geographic information VGI 7  , LinkedGeoData knowledge reflects the way in which the environment is experienced 8 . LinkedGeoData uses the information collected by the OpenStreetMap project with the aim of providing a rich integrated and interlinked geographic dataset for the Semantic Web.Finally  , we deploy the three implementations on an 85-node cluster and compare their scalability in terms of throughput. We then study how replication and data partitioning techniques allow us to scale individual data services of TPC-W.When no root is detected  , the algorithm retains the given word intact. In the root-based algorithm  , the main aim is to detect the root of the given word.We also performed a stand-alone ground truth evaluation of collusion and adjusted agreement. The method penalizes mirrors and near mirrors   , whereas genuine agreement between the sources is kept intact.Let D be any database and let D be obtained from D by possibly modifying the measure attribute values in each fact r arbitrarily but keeping the dimension attribute values in r intact. An allocation policy is said to be measure-oblivious if the following holds.The standard Dublin Core format is not suitable for RefSeq sequence data. From the NCBI site  , 4032 RefSeq records linked from our MEDLINE subset and that contain gene sequences were downloaded.All performance experiments use the TPC-H data set with a probabilistic schema containing uncertainty in the part  , orders  , customer  , supplier  w/P are in Gb. Performance Data.This definition is problematic because representation invariants are rarely expressed and even more rarely formalized in production software. Of course  , thread safety is not a precise concept: it is generally taken to mean that clients may only access a resource when the representation invariants of the resource are intact.Sampling uniformly from the Web is currently not possible 35  , so we sampled from the Open Directory Project ODP at dmoz.org. We initially wanted to choose a random set of websites that were representative of the Web at large.There were two t ypes of content-and-link runs used; a very simple sibling relationship implementation  , and another version that aimed to overcome some of the simpler run's short- comings. Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.As we increase the number of database servers  , partial replication performs significantly better than full replication. In TPC-W  , one server alone can sustain up to 50 EBs.The operative unit for stratification was the message  , and messages were assigned intact parent email together with all attachments to strata. Stratification followed the submission-based design noted above Section 2.1  , whereby one stratum was defined for messages all participants found relevant the " All-R " stratum  , another for messages no participant found relevant the " All-N " stratum  , and others for the various possible cases of conflicting assessment among participants.We chose to standardize this issue  , using the same criterion used by most evaluation tools  , e.g.  , those available for the Letor 3.0 and 4.0 and Microsoft datasets  , in order to allow fairer comparisons. assume the value of 1 for these cases  , which may lead to higher values of NDCG 2.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection. Therefore  , if A is relevant and B  , A's sibling  , has similar content to A then it is likely that B is relevant a s w ell.University dragon 16 Their result merging runs were based on normalizing the document score based on the resource score by a simple multiplication. Ultimately  , the rank based resource score combined with the document score on the RS baseline provided by the FedWeb team performed the best drexelRS7mW.Since the Web content  , user interactions  , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers  , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers. These interactions are emulated during benchmarking browsers by instrumented JavaScript which is independent of Web browsers.Given the large number of pages involved  , we used automatic classification. Firstly  , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory  , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.Once a week for 14 weeks we crawled each website and reconstructed it with Warrick. In this paper  , we describe an experiment using 300 randomly sampled websites from dmoz.org.This relatively modest hit rate is due to the fact that the standard TPC- W workload has very low query locality compared to real e-commerce sites 3. In TPC-W  , the cache had a hit rate of 18%.We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads. The test queries include output tests  , selections  , joins  , projections  , aggregates  , and updates.We illustrate the benefits of Hilda using a Course Management System and an Online Book Store application that is based on the TPC-W benchmark. The values we present in the next section are therefore averages over two runs of the simulation.The TPC-W benchmark Online Book Store illustrated a 35 percent improvement in response time for Hilda over a corresponding J2EE implementation. We showed that the performance of the CMS is comparable for both Hilda and J2EE  , and that Hilda gains on the amount of data transferred between the client and the server.The list-wise approach was proved to be more effective than pairwise and point-wise approaches  , as its optimization criterion is closer to the actual evaluation metrics. For list-wise LETOR  , we are using ListNet 6  , which uses a simple one layer Neural Network with Gradient Decent to optimize a defined list-wise loss function based on " top one probability " .In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies   , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark. We evaluated each detection strategy with ten different test scenarios and chose those that proved to be most accurate.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches. Search engines typically record the search strings entered by users and some search sites even make the history of past searches available to the user.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications  , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites. In this paper  , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.Based on the finding that different servlets of TPC-W benchmark have relatively consistent execution time  , Elnikety et al. These studies prioritize short requests so that they are serviced first  , while our approach actively detects and drops long requests. Resource selection: given a query  , a set of search engines/resources and a set of sample documents for each resource  , the goal of this task is to return a ranked list of search engines according to their relevance given the query. In FedWeb 2014  , participants are given 24 di‚Üµerent verticals e.g.  , news  , blogs  , videos etc.We conduced 5-fold cross validation experiments  , using the partitions in LETOR. The idea is similar to that of sitemap based relevance propagation 24.100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server  , " beatitude. " For example  , a DNS-based Our experiment showed high reliability for archiving using NNTP.The source tree ST is the only structure that our XPath evaluation and incremental maintenance algorithms require. From the source tree we can see that both fragments F2 and F3 are stored in the same site S2  , the nasdaq site.The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations. Projections.Some users are interested in highly unstructured text data OCRed from field journals  , or more conventional relational tables of data  , so BigSur does not require that these super-classes are used. This section of the schema is not mandatory.The Orkut graph is undirected since friendship is treated as a symmetric relationship. A user's vector has a 1 in any dimension that represents himself or anyone the user has listed as a " friend. "The first evaluation  , based on the LETOR datasets 17  , uses manual relevance assessments as ground-truth labels and synthetic clicks as feedback to BARACO. in two different ways.Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset  , we had to take this possibility into account. Regardless of the topic in question these sites would be ranked highest due to the number of inLinks associated with them.The data extraction experiment proceeded as follows: From the PSLNL documents  , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out.Following LETOR convention  , each dataset is divided into 5 folds with a 3:1:1 ratio for training  , validation  , and test set. 16  , here we investigate whether a simple unweighted average is sufficient to give improve- ments. offTopic: contains terms related to the query but unlikely to occur within relevant documents. The input to our method is a set of queries; each query is associated with Trels Term RELevance Sets  , which consist of two sets of terms: 1 http://dmoz.org  onTopic: contains terms related to the query that are likely to appear in relevant documents.As shown in Figure 2  , the documents selected by the two methods also exhibit very high similarity to each other. Both hedge and LETOR-like document selection methodology   , by design  , select as many relevant documents as possible .This is a semantic and applicationdependent decision. In general   , however  , the algorithm should not make a choice of which trees to prune and which to keep intact.We conduct experiments on eight standard collections  , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100  , AP88-90 with queries 51-150  , FBIS with queries 351-450  , FT91-94 with queries 301-400  , LA with queries 301-400  , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150  , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450. The number of topics Kt is set to be 400 as recommended in 15.About 300 training documents were available per topic. Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.To check this  , we used the pdftotext utility  , which extracts into plain UTF-8. One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.The primary metric of the TPC-W benchmark is WIPS  , which refers to the average number of Web Interactions Per Second completed . The defined data entries include the number of books in the database and the number of initial registered customers  , as well as the number of book photos of different sizes.We concentrated on developing repositories for four different resources: Medline for biomedical literature  , Refseq for gene DNA sequence  , Refseqp for protein sequence and Swissprot for protein sequence. Our main goal for this project was to create and integrate different biomedical resources using OAI-PMH.Moreover  , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded  , so they are intact. All other buffer pool pages are preserved.The spatial data is collected by the OpenStreetMap 5 project and it is available in RDF format. The goal of LinkedGeoData is to add a spatial dimension to the Semantic Web.Six collections  , relevant to the assignment about television and film personalities  , from various archives were indexed: 1 a television program collection containing 0.5M metadata records; 2 a photo collection with 20K photos of people working at television studio; 3 a wiki dedicated to actors and presenters 20K pages; 4 25K television guides that are scanned and OCRed; 5 scanned and OCRed newspapers between 1900 and 1995 6M articles; and 6 digital newspapers between 1995 and 2010 1M articles. Collections.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence  , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq. This software  , which is a wrapper around the popular Primer3 software package  , automatically designs primers for large numbers of genes in high throughput.Measures of semantic similarity based on taxonomies are well studied 14 . Web directories such as the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org provide user-compiled taxonomies of Web sites.By using the annotated hierarchical taxonomy of Web pages such as the one provided by ODP website http://dmoz.org/  , we can build a thematic lexicon. Both problems above could be solved by our proposed thematic lexicon.The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation. The first part is conducted on an Orkut community data set to evaluate the recommendation quality of LDA and ARM using top-k recommendations metric.For those objects left unexamined  , we have only a statistical assurance that the information is intact. 4.To examine consistency constraints beyond that of the standard TPC-W benchmark  , our distributed-bookstore benchmark adds the constraint of a finite inventory for each item. In our simple prototype system  , the total available inventory is divided among edge servers by giving each object instance aThe SVMRank 5 algorithm was used in this task and five-folds cross validation was done. Since a lot of features of LETOR we cannot get  , we droped those columns and then trained the ranking model.Others may be allowed to use the content only if left intact  , only for non-profit purposes  , or they might be allowed to manipulate it  , provided the original source is acknowledged  , for example. Users can license their content via Creative Commons with varying degrees of rights.The LETOR-like selection methodology also selects very similar documents  , since the documents selected are those that give high BM25 values and thus have similar characteristics. At the other end of the discrepancy scale  , infAP for small sampling percentages selects the most diverse relevant documents while it converges fast to the average discrepancy between documents in the complete collection.All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site. These browsers cover the most wellknown layout engines  , such as Trident and Gecko  , as well as several widely used JavaScript engines.Subsets of documents are chosen according to the six methods at different percentages of the complete document collection in our case the depth-100 pool  , and features are extracted from the selected query-document pairs. We employ five different document selection methodologies that are well studied in the context of evaluation  , along with the method used in LETOR for comparison purposes.The similar shapes for training and validation suggest that we are not overfitting. Secondly these all peak at or close to an Œ± of 0  , indicating that  , for LETOR OHSUMED at least  , we don't get any benefit from explicit use of the model's uncertainty information .Dataset. Note that streams for synthetic data differs from NASDAQ data in terms of the lag and the missing update distributions.NIST assessors referred to the WT2g collection during the process of ad hoc topic generation. Naturally  , there may be considerable variation from one topic to another.According to this methodology  , documents in the complete collection are first ranked by their BM25 scores for each query and the top-k documents are then selected for feature extraction.  LETOR: For comparison purposes  , a LETOR-like document selection methodology is also employed.Then  , the allocations produced by the policy are identical for corresponding facts in D and D . Let D be any database and let D be obtained from D by possibly modifying the measure attribute values in each fact r arbitrarily but keeping the dimension attribute values in r intact.Formal releases of these two broswers are expected to fix these problems. All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.Orkut is a general purpose social network. In this social network the friendship connections edges are directed.Web directories such as the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org provide user-compiled taxonomies of Web sites. In the case of resources  , semantic similarity refers to the degree of relatedness between two Web sites or documents  , as perceived by human subjects.In TPC-W  , updates to a database are always made using simple query. Similar figures are seen for other workload mixes of TPC-W.Although this model can potentially use a lot of bandwidth by sending all updates  , we see little need to optimize the bandwidth consumption for our TPC-W catalog object because the writes to reads ratio is quite small for the catalog information. The catalog instances at edge servers read the update  , apply it to the local database  , and serve it when requested by clients.The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this. Note that it is commonly believed that Rank-Boost performs equally well as Ranking SVM.A simple RefseqP XML schema was created for the RefSeqP OAI repository. Also  , 2072 Refseq records linked from our MEDLINE subset and that contain protein sequences were downloaded.However  , an intact partnership between Sender and Receiver would provide an open communication between them and prevent information hiding. 5.For simplicity we randomly sampled 300 websites from dmoz.org as our initial set of URLs. Finding a representative sample of websites is not trivial 14.This strategy is also more in line with intuition. and WT2g.Interestingly  , this algorithm can be used effectively in certain scenarios of incremental classification.   , and queue need to be initialized  , leaving the background ontology O p and possibly its classification information R t   , S t intact.We choose IBM DB2 for the database in our distributed TPC-W system. The messaging layer provides transactional send/receive for multiple messages.There are several avenues for future work. The TPC-W benchmark Online Book Store illustrated a 35 percent improvement in response time for Hilda over a corresponding J2EE implementation.To keep the data dependencies intact   , a more complex definition of ~ results  , which is given here without explanation for the amusement of the reader:  Applying improved array conditions to PC45  , 21 in figure 1 has the following effect. In the example   , it could be that i = j  , violating the data dependence definition for 1 ~ 3.We disabled the image downloading actions of RBEs as we want to only evaluate the response time of dynamic page generation of the edge server. We use the open source PHP implementation of TPC-W bench- mark 19.Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results  , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact. in the previous tables  , we see that generally both Recall and Precision are better on the sets s than for ~; here the exception is for the set ~ n ~  , for which precision is higher than for both z n S3 -d SI n %  , due to the large number of elements in this set 73% of the terms considered.The results of the state-ofthe-art algorithms are provided in the LETOR 3.0. In LETOR 3.0 package  , each dataset is partitioned into five for five-fold cross validation and each fold includes training   , testing and validation sets.We crawled TripAdvisor.com  , Hotels.com  , and Booking.com. We focus on location disambiguation problem across these three websites.In the hundred relation most of the attributes have exactly 100 unique AS3AP benchmark: the storage organization of the relation and the selectivity factor of the query. In the uniques relation all attributes have unique values.Table 9gives the numbers of directly and indirectly relevant documents. The WT2g connectivity data see http://pastime.anu.edu.au/WAR/WT2g_Links/ilink_WTonly.gz and the Small Web qrels file were used to find the set of documents which link directly to relevant documents.For reference  , we report the baseline score comparison in the following format: 3. 4 Our RankBoost baseline is comparable but different from LETOR18  , mainly due to different feature normalization mean-variance vs. 0  , 1 scaling.We use a non-linear Random Forest regression model for our experiments. To create features for the selection framework  , we use the published test runs 1 for these rankers to obtain the document scores for top 10 ranking documents  , and the list of 64 features that are available as part of LETOR.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available  , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; ‚Äì the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level  , e.g. ‚Äì the effect of sampling strategy on resource selection effectiveness  , e.g.Update operations on catalog data are performed at the backend and propagated to edge servers. In the distributed TPC-W system  , we use this object to manage catalog information  , which contains book descriptions  , book prices  , and book photos.In LETOR  , there are a total of 16 ,140 query-document pairs with relevance judgments  , and 25 extracted features. definitely  , possibly  , or not relevant.Their study focuses on discovering and explaining the bottleneck resources in each benchmark. 3  characterize the bottleneck of dynamic web site benchmarks  , including the TPC-W online bookstore and auction site.For instance  , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee ,_Tim/. The properties link were interpreted as rdf:type of the topics they belong to.The results of RankSVM  , RankBoost  , AdaRank and FRank are reported in the Letor data set. For AdaRank  , we use the version for optimizing the mean average precision for comparison in this study.For each topic  , we download 10 ,000 pages using the best-first algorithm. Web page classifiers based on SVM algorithm are trained beforehand for a few topics of DMOZ http://dmoz.org.We conducted 5-fold cross validation experiments  , following the guideline of Letor. In total  , there are 44 features.We first discuss our baseline  , which is the current production system of the destination finder at Booking.com. In this section  , we present our ranking approaches for recommendations of travel destinations.This data set was tailor-made to benefit remainderprocessing. Because the TPC-W dataset had so little overlap  , we generated a dataset with the same butuseda10-wordvocabulary{w0 ,w1 ,w2 ,‚Ä¶ ,w9}forthe title field.For segments like new york times subscription  , the answer of whether it should be left intact as a compound concept or further segmented into multiple atomic concepts depends on the connection strength of the components i.e. Ideally  , each segment should map to exactly one " concept " .It is worth noting that the quality of and issues with cross references between multiple biological data sources is not well documented and often requires extensive experimentation in collecting and integrating data from these sources. EBI's Genome Reviews 14 had better annotations and cross references than RefSeq  , and therefore was selected as IMG's main source for public microbial genome data.Depending on the user's option  , three possible scenarios can be generated from this pattern. With further customization  , the user can enable three possible methods for refreshing data from Nasdaq.We evaluated the performances of SST by adopting a n-fold cross validation strategy on the SemCor corpus exploited for training. TaggerEvaluation.Table 11shows the accuracy of FACTO. The result pages of Ask.com with fact answers can be accessed at http://lepton.research.microsoft.com/facto/doc/ask_answer.zip.image or video files  , so the big-documents for such engines by concatenating the text from all its sampled pages would be empty  , which causes such resources would not be selected for any queries. In addition  , for some search engines  , like the resource e122 Picasa in FedWeb 2014  , all the sampled pages are non-text files  , e.g. To reduce maturation effects  , i.e. Consequently the original datasets were left intact.Finally  , we evaluate the proposed method on LETOR 3.0 benchmark collections1. The empirical results indicate that even with sparse models  , the ranking performance is still comparable to that of the standard gradient descent ranking algorithm.Actually  , the results of Ranking SVM are already provided in LETOR. In comparison with this baseline  , we can see whether Relational Ranking SVM can effectively leverage relation information to perform better ranking.We compare the NDCG-Annealing algorithm with linear ranking function described in section 3 with baselines provided in the LETOR 3.0 datasets. The NDCG-Annealing algorithm is general to be applied to both linear and non-linear ranking functions at test time.The Item_basic data service is read-only. Figure 4shows the throughput scalability of three representative data services from the scalable TPC-W.For brevity  , we report MAP as the measure of system performance . This latter question is a matter of some interest  , as the MAP scores for LETOR 3 approach the 65% considered achievable with human-adjudicated relevance 5.On SemSearch ES  , ListSearch and INEX-LD  , where the queries are keyword queries like 'Charles Darwin'  , LeToR methods show significant improvements over FSDM. The overall improvements on all queries can be as large as 8%.On the other three collections  , the performance of all the three PRoc models is very close. In addition  , from Table 4 we observe that PRoc3 outperforms the other two on the WT2G collection.The document collection is a subset of MEDLINE  , a database on medical publications. The OHSUMED data set in LETOR has been derived from the OHSUMED benchmark data 16 for information retrieval research.The automated and generic nature of our instrumentation makes our approach transparent and helps developers keep their original source code intact. Moreover  , persistence is a cross-cutting concern   , so scattered changes are need over the application's code  , making it less maintainable.the number of query topics  , on ranking performance by conducting comparison study with varying the value of n. Figure 3show the performance of TRSVM on Letor dataset with varying values of n in terms of MAP. In this experiment  , we explore the effects of different settings of the parameter n  , i.e.Hence  , we only compare the proposal algorithm with Ranking-SVM  , but not Rank-Boost. The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this.UiSPP Linear combination of the Document-centric and Collection-centric models. This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection Nguyen et al.  , 2012.We are not surprised that our systems did not work well on diversity metrics as shown in Table 3  , because the diversity module of our system was not functioning as we expected and eventually we chose to not to include it in our pipeline. This also suggests that our LETOR framework is effective in improving the overall precision.Many " viral " videos take off on social media only after being featured on broadcast media  , which often follows their being highlighted on intermediary sites such as Reddit or Buzzfeed. The emergent media ecology is a mix of old and new media which is not strictly segregated by platform or even by device.BM25 instead of the TF¬∑IDF; ‚Äì the use of external evidence to obtain a more effective information need representation. by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available  , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; ‚Äì the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level  , e.g.First  , conditions which constrain a variable to a small discrete interval are automatically translated into a disjunction of possible values. To keep the data dependencies intact   , a more complex definition of ~ results  , which is given here without explanation for the amusement of the reader:  Applying improved array conditions to PC45  , 21 in figure 1 has the following effect.Table 8shows the results of all of the single-pass retrieval methods on three collections. Table 7: Optimal hyper-parameter on all retrieval methods over both types of verbose queries tuned for MAP on WT2g.The feature extraction step uses OCRed text and the bounding box information to calculate line features for every text line contained within a scanned volume. There are two steps in the automatic metadata generation process: feature extraction and metadata labeling.Topic labels were taken from the 219 topics from the top two levels of the Open Directory Project ODP  , http://dmoz.org  , and included topics such as " Health/Medicine " and " Recreation/Sports " . If no results were returned by the engine  , no label was assigned.We chose the TPC-W benchmark and evaluated the performance of GlobeDB in comparison to other existing systems for different throughput values over an emulated wide-area network. In this section  , we study the performance gain that could be obtained using GlobeDB while hosting an ecommerce application.In this section  , we evaluate the consistency of our distributed TPC-W system during normal operation by examining the staleness of local inventory. Because the system slightly relaxes consistency for higher availability and performance  , during the normal system operation or network failures users may view stale information.There are 106 queries in the collection split into five folds. We also analyze the results of our approach on a different dataset; OHSUMED 5 which is also available in Letor 16.Previously  , sentiment diversification was mainly applied to controversial topics which required opinionated documents to appear in retrieval results 7. Having this in mind  , FedWeb dataset seemed appropriate for our experiments as it provides the federated environment on which we could incorporate opinions in federated search.We observe up to 25 fold speedups in this distributed setting for the Microsoft LETOR data set. Fold 1 n=723K Set 1 n=473K Set 2 n=35K Perfect Figure 4: The speedups of pGBRT on the cluster as a function of CPU cores.848 hotels were matched across all three sites  , 1007 between Booking.com and Hotels.com  , 655 between Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com  , and 10 ,590 between Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com. Results of disambiguation Using these constraints  , we find 13 ,100 total matches.We collected all the reviews for some hotels in these sites. We crawled TripAdvisor.com  , Hotels.com  , and Booking.com.In Letor  , the data is represented as feature vectors and their corresponding relevance labels . There are 16 ,140 query-document pairs with relevance labels.The disambiguation system we used SUDS is based on a statistical language model constructed from the manually sense tagged Brown1 part of the Semcor corpus. This indicates that SUDS can provide a more accurate representation of a collection than simply ignoring sense given that it is more accurate than frequency only tagging.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method  , we performed a systematic set of experiments using the LETOR benchmark collections OHSUMED  , TD2004  , and TD2003 and several evaluation measures MAP  , NDCG and precision . This information may turn the generated rules more discriminative and accurate.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of Linear Ranking SVM. For all the SVM models in the experiment  , we employed Linear SVM. The DjVu XML file retains the bounding box information of every single OCRed word  , from which we can estimate format features. Figure 3shows logical structure and bounding box information embedded within a DjVu XML document.Also  , 2072 Refseq records linked from our MEDLINE subset and that contain protein sequences were downloaded. oai_dc: contains only the accession id in the title field to satisfy the mandatory requirement of OAI 1.dataset by merging the original partitions into a single set  , and splitting the sorted queries into 5 folds  , distributed using the same proportions: 3 folds for training  , 1 for validation and 1 for test. For comparative purposes  , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure  , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO!Ultimately  , the rank based resource score combined with the document score on the RS baseline provided by the FedWeb team performed the best drexelRS7mW. On the other side  , the document score was based on its reciprocal rank of the selected resource.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications. To the best of our knowledge  , there exists no previous benchmark which can automatically emulate the process of user Web surfing in a way fair to Web browsers.For the TPC-W benchmark  , PPD excludes Synchronized Methods and Database Locks as potential root causes in its first iteration. If the response time of the JDBC-Calls increases disproportionally with the workload while no physical resource is fully utilized  , DB locks are a potential root cause of the observed performance problem.Next  , we discuss how the data types and queries are implemented in U-DBMS. All other existing data types and operators in the PostgreSQL system dotted-line boxes remain intact.Experimental results  , obtained using the LETOR benchmark  , indicate that methods that learn to rank at query-time outperform the state-ofthe-art methods. By generating rules on a demand-driven basis  , depending on the documents to be ranked  , only the necessary information is extracted from the training data  , resulting in fast and effective ranking methods.We crawled 1 ,546 ,441 Web pages from ODP which spanned over 172 ,565 categories. The existing intermediate taxonomy used in the paper is from Open Directory Project ODP  , http://dmoz.org/.In order to exclude network performance problems  , we redeployed the TPC-W benchmark to Setup B which provides a higher network bandwidth. The additional traffic leads to collisions that even result in a declining throughput for high load Curve 2 in Figure 5a and long response times Bar 2 in Figure 5b.TPC- W models an on-line bookstore and defines workloads that exercise different parts of the system such as the Web server  , database server  , etc. We deployed the TPC-W benchmark in the edge servers.Following conventional treatment  , we also augmented each feature vector by a constant term 1. For article features  , we normalized URL and Editor categories together  , and kept the CTR term a real value intact .We collected concrete examples of research tasks  , and classified them into categories. Through interviews we conducted with scholars  , we learned that while the uncertain quality of OCRed text in archives is seen as a serious obstacle to wider adaption of digital methods in the humanities  , few scholars can quantify the impact of OCR errors on their own research tasks.We conducted experiments using TPC-D benchmark data TPC93 o n N T w orkstation running DB2 4 . We are currently investigating this hypothesis.Finally  , generated metadata information and OCRed text are integrated to support navigation and retrieval of content within scanned volumes. After the scanning and text recognition process  , the metadata generation system generates metadata describing the internal structure of the scanned volume and published articles contained within the volume.Table 1shows the results obtained by evaluating our resource selection approaches on the FedWeb 2013 collection. In Section 3  , we evaluate the performance with different K values.Results for the chosen categories are illustrated in Table 2  , reporting Precision  , Recall and F 1 for any Supersense. We evaluated the performances of SST by adopting a n-fold cross validation strategy on the SemCor corpus exploited for training.We compare our proposed NDCG-Annealing algorithm with those baselines provided in LETOR 3.0. As a result  , the NDCG-Annealing algorithm is more stable and pronounced compared to the baselines in LETOR 3.0 dataset.Some examples are: How does the snippet quality influence results merging strategies ? Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context  , there are also new research challenges that readily appear  , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.Reputation systems are important to the e-commerce ecosystem . 32 leveraged magnetic honeypot ads to study Nigerian scams on Craigslist.All subsequent links pass through the proxy server and are redirected to the vendor system with session connection information intact. Figure 2The short entry results are displayed to the user  , via a proxy server  , from the actual vendor system that was searched.We have implemented most of our ranking algorithms implemented using Lucene. Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible  , without using any external processing engine or resources  , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit.Since the document relevance inferred from the PCC and DBN models is better than that from the CCM model in the above two experiments  , we only consider the PCC and DBN models in this part of experiment. For each query and document  , we extract about three hundred of features in the experiment  , where the features are similar to those defined in LETOR16.Another example is the LinkedGeoData project 4 which provides Linked Data about any circular and rectangular area on Earth 4. Example 1 illustrates that such cases are possible in practice.Further  , the discrepancy among the selected relevant documents   , along with the discrepancy among the selected relevant and non-relevant documents for the different selection methods is illustrated in Figures 2. The LETOR-like selection achieves both high precision and recall at small percentages of data used for training up to 5% and then it drops to the levels of statAP and depth pooling.For example  , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification. As a final remark  , although XVCL pushes the envelope further on unifying clones  , one should apply it only when the benefit is worth the effort.However  , there is little tool support for maintaining open  , webaccessible bibliographies to collect relevant publications in dynamic areas  , e.g. on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.Similarity ranking measures the relevance between a query and a document. In this paper  , 3 http://dmoz.org/ SocialPageRank is proposed to explore static ranking from social annotations and capture the preference of web annotators.We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models. We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting  , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model.The mean partitions the block access distribution more effectively than an approach based on percentiles since  , paradoxically  , it is less affected by clustered values. Thus both clusters are left intact.We scaled the TPC-W database to 10 ,000 items and 288 ,000 customers  , which corresponds to 350 MB of data. The database contains multiple tables that are meant to represent the data needed to maintain a real site  , including customers  , addresses  , orders  , credit card information  , individual items  , authors  , and countries.Unlike TPC-W  , the RUBBoS workload has quite high database query locality. However  , even in this case the system throughput is increased by 33%  , from 450 to 600 EBs.Its responsiveness performance is closer to users' perception than any of other benchmarks. Since the Web content  , user interactions  , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers  , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers.It would be useful to delete such a sentence  , while leaving the rest of the sequence intact  , but as yet we have not given this matter enough attention to know whether such a procedure would be safe. For instance  , an otherwise tidy sequence of sentences may include one which contains some undesirable feature see end of Section 11.5  , below.The first is the unique document found containing both of the words " income " and " forecast " as well as the American Tobacco Company logo and a dollar amount a recognized entity type greater than $500K. We apply conjunctive constraints on document image components to a straightforward document ranking based on total query-word frequency in the OCRed document text; in Fig- ure 2we show document images retrieved for two such queries.However   , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster. This means that as users became more overloaded  , they replied to a smaller fraction of incoming emails and with shorter replies.Based on the observation  , title pages have relatively fewer number of text lines and larger average distance between text lines  , and they contain text lines indicating volume number and issue number in issue title pages. We use rule-based approach for title detection using page and line features calculated from OCRed text  , bounding box information  , and context analysis.The rootbased algorithm is aggressive. When no root is detected  , the algorithm retains the given word intact.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried  , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion. There are also features taken from the query that are independent from documents  , including query length  , the average  , minimum  , maximum of the collection frequencies of the query terms.Distributed objects may be a simple way to achieve both high availability and good consistency for some large-scale systems in the wide area network. In this section we discuss the design and evaluation of the key distributed objects in the distributed TPC-W system.Thus  , these results indicate that training over a collection of given characteristics cannot always lead to an effective ranking function when the function is deployed to rank documents in a collection of radically different characteristics. The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines.Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists  , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method. We introduce a two-pass retrieval framework  , where in the first pass we aim to retrieve as many relevant document as possible to ensure a reasonable level of recall  , and in the second pass we process all the retrieved documents in the first pass and extract features.To do this automatically we use the content-based classifier described and evaluated in 1. As in the prior studies  , we label the results visited by users across their long-term search histories using category labels from the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org.In particular  , TPC-W benchmark defines the catalog update operations as 0.11% of all operations in the workload. Although this model can potentially use a lot of bandwidth by sending all updates  , we see little need to optimize the bandwidth consumption for our TPC-W catalog object because the writes to reads ratio is quite small for the catalog information.Therefore  , we have adopted Reciprocal Rank as the data fusion techniques in our final submissions. Our LETOR algorithms behave differently on some topics  , but Condorcet method tends to ignore high votes from the minority  , but instead prefer weak votes from the majority.A transaction is an update transaction with probability update tran prob  , and a read-only transaction with probability 1 ‚Äì update tran prob. Our session time and think time mean values are taken from the TPC-W benchmark 31.There is ample research into how to reduce the error rates of OCRed text in a post-processing phase. While this makes it easier for scholars to use the archive  , it also denies them the possibility to investigate potential tool-induced bias.I would like to express my appreciation to the secretary of ECPA  , Yola de Lusenet  , for her input and suggestions during the preparation of this paper. The question  , therefore  , will not be how and when the latter will take over  , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact  , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data. Due to the lack of In addition to topics 401-450  , we have executed a number of manual queries on the software.Note that this performance target is quite challenging  , as several query templates have execution times greater than 100 ms  , even under low loads see a TPC-W  , 900 EBs. We first set a performance target in terms of query execution latency: in our experiments we aim at processing at least 90% of database queries within 100 ms.Among the dissimilarities  , the following are noteworthy: a Information services/goods and network services have many more parameters other than just price and quantity  , which describe the products and services. Nasdaq.However  , any publishsubscribe system implementing the optimal centralized algorithm in XPath query processing 18 would require a single depth-first traversal of the document tree visiting  , in our example  , twice the nasdaq server. Publish-subscribe systems are more in-line with moving the processing to the data.Table 3 shows the various statistics about the datasets. The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP  , http: //snap.stanford.edu.52 % of these links reference another document within WT2g but only 0.12 % reference a different server within WT2g. On average  , each document within the collection includes 9.13 outgoing links.Each data set is partitioned on queries to perform 5 fold cross-validation. The results of RankSVM  , RankBoost  , AdaRank and FRank are reported in the Letor data set.For our English baselines  , relevance feedback improved the title-only queries  , but did not appreciably change when longer topic statements were used. In Table 5 we report the percentage of mean average precision achieved by each bilingual run performed with intact translation resources when pre-translation expansion was not used.The relevancy judgments provided in OHSUMED are scored 0  , 1 or 2 and there are 45 features for each querydocument pair. The datasets provided in the LETOR There are 106 queries in the OSHUMED dataset.For meta search aggregation problem we use the LETOR 14  benchmark datasets. Given an aggregate ranking œÄ  , and relevance levels L  , NDCG is defined as:Example. In this way  , the global schema remains intact.The ODP indexes a wide variety of websites in over 40 languages  , and all search engines have an equal chance of indexing it. Sampling uniformly from the Web is currently not possible 35  , so we sampled from the Open Directory Project ODP at dmoz.org.It is not known at this stage  , what proportion of the dead links those whose target lies outside WT2g are inter-server links and how many are references to same-server pages which happen to be missing from the VLC2 1 . 52 % of these links reference another document within WT2g but only 0.12 % reference a different server within WT2g.Consequently the original datasets were left intact.  Subjects' authoring and design experiences were mostly scaled little or average  , with a low difference between skill levels.This may seem contradictory with results from the previous section. One should note that GlobeTP has greater effect on the latency in the case of RUBBoS than for TPC-W.The Rice TPC-W implementation includes a workload generator   , which is a standard closed-loop session-oriented client emulator . For locking in the database  , think time has an average of 8 seconds and bounded to 80 seconds.The existing intermediate taxonomy used in the paper is from Open Directory Project ODP  , http://dmoz.org/. In this paper  , all the experiments use only the 800 queries  , except in the ensemble classifiers  , where we use the 111 sample queries to tune the weight of each single classifier.Feature examples include TF  , IDF  , LMIR and BM25 considering  , result title  , abstract  , body  , url and pagerank values. The training features are the ones used in LETOR benchmark 2 and are described in 2.The think times of emulated browsers are modeled by using two different MAPs 2  , each with a different burstiness profile. TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing  , shopping  , and ordering mixes.Actually  , full-fledged functional templating is supported only by MediaWiki and Wikia which is MediaWikibased . A first fact is the different support between creational and functional templates: about a half of the clones adopt a creational approach  , while less than a fifth adopt a functional one.Semcor is a manually sense tagged subset of the Brown Corpus consisting of 352 Documents split into three data sets see Table 1. Each Synset contains words which are synonymous with each other  , while the links between Synsets represent hypernymy and hyponomy relationships to form a hierarchical semantic network.One should note that GlobeTP has greater effect on the latency in the case of RUBBoS than for TPC-W. We therefore use RR-QID for measurements of TPC-W  , and costbased routing for RUBBoS.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic. The second and third requirements ruled out a uniform 2 % sample.This logical structure information can be used to help the metadata extraction process. In each DjVu XML file  , the OCRed text is organized in a page  , paragraph  , line  , and word hierarchy.they display graph properties similar to measurements of other popular social networks such as Orkut 25. First  , our prior analysis 35  showed that they are representative of measured social graphs  , i.e.This work is situated in the context of an information extraction framework developed in 6  , 7. Thus  , the problem to be solved in this paper is to develop flexible techniques for discovering patterns in PSLNL documents.Given a concurrent execution of a set of transactions i.e.  , an interleaved sequence of operations compensation for one of the transactions  , T  , can be modeled as an attempt to cancel the operations of T while leaving the rest of the sequence intact. In the classical transaction model only the sequences are dealt with  , whereas the programs are abstracted and ire of little use.TPC Benchmark W TPC-W is an industry-standard transactional web benchmark that models an online bookstore 34. Another metric is the Web Interaction Response Time  , WIRT  , which is used for measuring the latency of the system.This has been used extensively in previous work on personalization to model search interests at a level beyond queries and documents 524 . Topic: We utilize the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org  , a human-generated hierarchical taxonomy of Websites  , as our topical ontology.It consists of almost 20 million nodes vectors and 2 billion links non-zero weights  , yielding roughly . The Orkut graph is undirected since friendship is treated as a symmetric relationship.To test interaction with Craigslist  , we search for and then post an advertisement. The test for basic functionality at Craigslist uses the browser to browse advertisements in the San Francisco bay area sfbay.craigslist.org.The results are reported for the BPR loss function  , which achieved the best results for the Newsvine dataset in accordance with the previous subsection. Table 6shows the obtained results when using the tags  , co-commenting and social signals   , compared to using only the tags and co-commenting signals.BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection. Therefore   , it is fair to compare them on these four collections.These data could be used by the participants to build resource descriptions . The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries  , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.The method penalizes mirrors and near mirrors   , whereas genuine agreement between the sources is kept intact. These experiments satisfy the two desiderata of collusion detection we discussed in Section 5.Tables showing  , for each topic  , the stratum-by-stratum partitioning of the collection  , the samples drawn from each stratum  , and the pre-and post-adjudication assessments attached to those samples are provided in an appendix to this document Appendix A. The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message  , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents  , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data. The Disk4&5 collection contains newswire articles from various sources  , such as Association Press AP  , Wall Street Journal WSJ  , Financial Times FT  , etc.  , which are usually considered as high-quality text data with little noise.Thus  , line features are designed to estimate properties of OCRed text within a line  , which can be calculated based on OCRed text and bounding box information in the DjVu XML file. Additionally  , text within the same line usually has the same style.But we have observed from the TPC-W and RUBBoS benchmarks that many such queries can easily be rewritten as a sequence of simpler queries spanning one table each. Of course  , queries spanning multiple tables are occasionally indispensable to the application.The TPC-W Benchmark 24 emulates an online bookstore providing twelve different request types for browsing and ordering products and two request types for administrative purposes. For this case study  , we use a fixed sequence of TPC-W requests.The second evaluation  , based on the WSDM 2014 Web search personalization challenge  , 1 uses dwell time as ground-truth labels and real clicks as feedback to BARACO. The first evaluation  , based on the LETOR datasets 17  , uses manual relevance assessments as ground-truth labels and synthetic clicks as feedback to BARACO.We selected a load of 900 EBs for TPC-W and 330 EBs for RUBBoS  , so that the tested configurations would be significantly loaded. In all cases we used 4 database servers and one query router.Our distributed TPC-W system can operate normally while being partitioned because the databases are replicated locally through distributed objects  , and they can continuously provide data for server computation while partitioned by network outage. It implies that the throughput of systems with both messaging layers is consistent throughout the session  , and the network failures during the session have little effect on the system.To illustrate the benefits of GlobeTP  , we measured the query execution latencies of read and UDI queries together using different configurations. As we will see in the next section   , the throughput improvements that GlobeTP provides are significantly greater for TPC-W than RUBBoS.We plot the log of negative log-likelihood due to scale of the values  , and so lower value implies that model has higher likelihood. Figures 4b shows the performance of our model in comparison with the best baseline B3 over the NASDAQ.Our LETOR algorithms behave differently on some topics  , but Condorcet method tends to ignore high votes from the minority  , but instead prefer weak votes from the majority. This observation is similar to that in 22  , and it is likely to be the case that false positives that are common in all 4 posting lists will likely to receive higher ranking than true positives that are supported by a subset of posting lists.The ODP metadata being used was downloaded from dmoz.org in September 2004  , and contains 0.6 million categories and 4.4 million leaf nodes. Two datasets are used in our experiments to measure performance: a sample of 12 ,000 web pages from ODP and a sample of 2 ,000 web pages from the Stanford WebBase collection 9.the entire WT2g Dataset  , both for inLinks and outLinks. Using recently acquired hardware we have reduced this time to below 2 seconds per query.By distributing the bookstore inventory among all edge servers  , the system allows edge servers to accept orders locally. In this section  , we evaluate the consistency of our distributed TPC-W system during normal operation by examining the staleness of local inventory.We compare the average users' response time  , which we refer to as responsiveness  , of a Hilda implementation and a J2EE implementation of the two applications. We illustrate the benefits of Hilda using a Course Management System and an Online Book Store application that is based on the TPC-W benchmark.In addition   , we also introduce our failed attempt of using topic models to perform query expansion to capture documents of multiple topics in section 5  , and a brief reflection on why this approach did not work. In the rest of this paper  , we will introduce the general pipeline of our retrieval system in Section 2  , followed by an introduction to novel Language Modelling approaches in Section 3 that were used to generate features  , and later in Section 4 we introduce all other features and the LETOR algorithms.For datasets  , we used MQ2007 and MQ2008  , a collection of benchmarks released in 2009 by Microsoft Research Asia research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/beijing/projects/letor/. The depth of the complete solution is d = 8.The first part is conducted on an Orkut community data set to evaluate the recommendation quality of LDA and ARM using top-k recommendations metric. We divide our experiments into two parts.3  characterize the bottleneck of dynamic web site benchmarks  , including the TPC-W online bookstore and auction site. Amza et al.We have presented a client-side architecture for the enforcement  , creation and testing of browser security policies. Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy  , but the application functionality remains intact.The emulated bookstore meets the requirements of a realistic enterprise application  , which is essential for the evaluation of our approach. The TPC-W Benchmark 24 emulates an online bookstore providing twelve different request types for browsing and ordering products and two request types for administrative purposes.In particular  , the culprit was single-digit OCR errors in the scanned article year. This turned out to be an artifact of OCRed metadata.We expect the pairwise methods to perform better than point-wise approaches  , as the features collected from the error pairs are more meaningful as they define relative distances. We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR  , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.The source code of the latest distributed TPC-W bookstore implementation is only three thousand lines more than that of the centralized version  , excluding the messaging layer implementation. To quantify the simplicity of our distributed bookstore system  , we compare the size of source code for both centralized and distributed implementations.We would then examine the surrounding sentence if it contained any collocates we had observed from Semcor  , the word would be tagged with the corresponding sense. Using a context window consisting of the sentence surrounding the target word we would identify all possible senses of the word.On the other hand  , we found that unifying designlevel similarities with XVCL is almost always beneficial  , as it considerably reduces perceived program complexity. For example  , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.One of our participants  , an 18-year-old student  , was not only technologically-savvy in terms of adopting new websites and exploring advanced features of computer applications  , she was also a strong " gifter. " One reason for the ubiquity of Orkut is most likely due to the power of influencers and the practice of account gifting.From the remaining 306 topics  , we selected 75 topics as follows. We started from the 506 topics gathered for FedWeb 2013 5  , leaving out the 200 topics provided to the FedWeb 2013 participants.We posted a message asking people to tell us how they used the web to form and promote their opinions and used their responses to select people who we thought might fit our " skeptical reader " and " activist " personas. For the first two studies  , we recruited participants using Craigslist.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset  , consisting of 247 ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements. In order to test whether the associated hypothesis is true  , we developed a software application which would produce results based on conventional Content Analysis the baseline result and then re-rank those results based on a number of related Connectivity Analysis approaches.Zhu  , Kraut  , and Kittur 2014 examine community survival as a function of multiple memberships within Wikia communities. In contrast  , our work performs a similar computational analysis   , but also identifies the platform and motivational factors involved.We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in ¬ß2. We bring together two existing experimental techniques to launch a thorough study of topic-based properties of the Web: the ability to classify a Web page into predefined topics using a high-speed automatic classifier  , and the ability to draw near-uniform samples from the Web graph using random walks.We use the completion of a small application request the home page of TPC-W to indicate that the application instance is active. We repeat this experiment with various competing CPU loads by exercising the CPU-bound application in the background.In addition  , we define constraints to forbid impossible value assignments for t1  , . That is  , it reduces the values proposed by untrustworthy sources to utterly uncertain values P cv = eq = 1/2 if pt = 0  , while keeping the values of trustworthy sources intact P cv = eq = c if pt = 1.For comparative purposes  , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure  , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO! Similarly to the WEB10K benchmark  , these datasets are partitioned into 5 folds to be used in a folded cross-validation procedure.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of linear RankSVM. For all the SVM models in the experiment  , we employ the linear SVM.Figure 4 is the high-level pseudo code of our algorithm. We opt for leaving the fully utilized instances intact as they already make good contributions.To our knowledge  , we are the first paper to explicitly parallelize CART 5  tree construction for the purpose of gradient boosting. On the Microsoft LETOR data set  , we see a small decrease in accuracy  , but the speedups are even more impressive.Ranking functions exhibit their second worst performance when trained over data sets constructed according to the LETOR-like document selection methodology. the performance of RankBoost  , Regression and RankNet with the hidden layer.These criteria  , also known as significant properties  , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention. Again  , these evaluations will be performed according to multiple criteria.The motivation in this case was to find queries of a similar type e.g.  , navigational or information queries  , but no improvements were observed with smaller training sets such as Letor. There have been some attempts to do this 1  , 4.In order to avoid clutter  , only a representative subset of baselines is shown  , including the best and the worst of them. Figure 3b compares FITC-Rank with the LETOR base- lines 9 .Three sample queries are shown: the " Exec Search " request  , which is relatively inexpensive with an execution time of about 400 milliseconds   , shown in Figure 11; the " Admin Response " request  , which is complex and weighs in at roughly 4.8 seconds  , shown in Fig- ure 12; and the " Average " request  , shown in Figure 13  , the average across all queries in TPC-W  , which is 425 milliseconds. Figures 11  , 12 and 13 show response times under both the FIFO and SJF policies   , distinguishing execution time from waiting time.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise. We also assume a trusted and independent audit log validation service which  , given access to a copy of the database  , will verify the validity of the audit log.The index matching service that finds all web pages containing certain keywords is heavy-tailed. The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com 2 with different size distribution characteristics: a database index matching service and a page ranking service.They found the cosine similarity measure to show the best empirical results against other measures. 5 present an empirical comparison of six measures of similarity for recommending communities to members of the Orkut social network.The negative correlation in the informational setting of NP2003 dataset is due to a heavily skewed distribution of candidate rankers when the production ranker is at a Figure 4: The ROC curves for BARACO and MT  , using DBN for generation and interpretation  , TD2004 dataset  , informational user model LETOR evaluation. These results show that BARACO again outperforms the EM-based method.The WT2g connectivity data see http://pastime.anu.edu.au/WAR/WT2g_Links/ilink_WTonly.gz and the Small Web qrels file were used to find the set of documents which link directly to relevant documents. ACSys has attempted to determine whether this was the case by looking at the indirectly relevant documents retrieved by the runs listed in Table 7.We then compare its performance to " DTW "   , which represents the denormalized TPC-W where no particular measure has been taken to scale up individual services. We compare three implementations of TPC-W. " OTW " represents the unmodified original TPC-W implementation.In TPC-W  , GlobeTP processes 20% more queries within 10 ms than full replication. For example  , in RUBBOS GlobeTP processes 40% more queries than full replication within 10 ms.P -perfect user model setting  , I -informational  , N -navigational LETOR eval- uation. The error bars are standard errors of the means.Each emulated client represents a virtual user. The Rice TPC-W implementation includes a workload generator   , which is a standard closed-loop session-oriented client emulator .Such information can only be retrieved via simple keyword-based search  , unless the data is extracted and stored in a more structured form  , such as XML or relational tuples. Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.We employ five different document selection methodologies that are well studied in the context of evaluation  , along with the method used in LETOR for comparison purposes. If yes  , which one of these methods is better for this purpose ? "Although other approaches to identifier splitting have used a dictionary to further split identifier words with no boundaries 15  , 24  , such as " scrollbar " or " textfield  , " in this work we have conservatively chosen to leave such words intact. Body statements present additional challenges in determining appropriate direct and indirect objects.TPC-W 3  for example includes the WGEN program that populates the benchmark's text attributes using a static collection of words and a grammar. It is being used in speech synthesis  , benchmarking  , and text retrieval research.As a result  , the NDCG-Annealing algorithm is more stable and pronounced compared to the baselines in LETOR 3.0 dataset. We also see from Figure 4 that our NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms all the other baseline algorithms on this dataset.Early work kept the basic principles of the model intact   , while adding nesting Mos87  , BBG89  or exploiting commutativity properties of a general set of database operations as opposed to simply read and write Kor83  , BR92  , Weiss. A basic theme that runs through these three papers as well as others appearing around that time is the following: The consequences of rigid adherence to the ACID properties are too draconian for these then-new applications  , yet there is an appeal to the conceptual framework of the transaction abstraction that should not be entirely abandoned.The ability of our models to take into account different levels of uncertainty for different data produces effective models  , and  , for FITC-Rank in particular  , performance is consistent across experiments and gives significant improvements against the baseline models. We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.For each query and document  , we extract about three hundred of features in the experiment  , where the features are similar to those defined in LETOR16. We follow the RankNet 5 method which is a pairwise ranking algorithm receiving the pairwise preferences to optimize the ranking function.We also applied the algorithm to rank ads with non-linear ranking function described in section 7 in contextual advertising in both online and offline scenarios. The results on seven datasets in LETOR 3.0 show that the NDCG-Annealing algorithm can outperform the baselines and it is more stable.They may still be restored with edits intact simply by loading them." If I were to open this icon  , I would see: "The following files were edited but not saved.They concluded that CORI  , and a modified version of the CORI algorithm  , performed reasonably effectively at the server selection task. 5 evaluated CORI  , vGlOSS  , and CVV in a testbed based on the 2GB  , 956 server WT2g crawl of the Web.These data could be used by the participants to build resource descriptions. The FedWeb 2013 collection contains search result pages for many other queries  , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.The first set contains transaction Purchase  , and the two atomic sets Docart and Getcart; the second set contains the Adminconfirm transaction  , the third set contains only the Updaterelated transaction. First  , the transactions and atomic sets of the TPC-W workload impose the creation of four sets of transactions whose targeted data do not overlap.Reductions help find syntactically simpler forms of an expression while keeping its semantics intact. A particularly inspiring feature of the AQL optimizer is that it has the powerful capability of optimizing operators or newly added functions on the calculus level  , i.e.  , by application of variations of Œª-calculus reductions over the operators definitions.Some bins had more  , some less  , than 500 documents  , due to the fact that messages were assigned to bins intact parent email together with all attachments  , making it impossible to see that every bin had exactly 500 documents. Once samples were drawn  , the messages in each sample were randomly divided into " bins " of approximately 500 documents each.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection. This test collection consists of sampled search results from 149 web search engines crawled between April and May 2014.We substantiate these claims through extensive experimentation of a prototype implementation running the TPC-W benchmark over an emulated wide-area net- work. Our system provides Web-based data-intensive applications the same advantages that content delivery networks offer to traditional Web sites: low latency and reduced network usage.Figure 5and Figure 6show the results on the Letor TD2003 and TD2004 datasets. We tried treating 'partially relevant' as 'irrelevant'  , it did not work well for SVM map .To compute these metrics we used the standard evaluation tool available for the LETOR 3.0 benchmark for binary datasets  , as well the tool available for the Microsoft dataset for all multi-label relevance judgment datasets 5 . The statistical tests are computed over the values for Mean Average Precision MAP and the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at the top 10 retrieved documents hereafter   , NDCG@10  , the two most important and frequently used performance metrics to evaluate a given permutation of a ranked list using binary and multi-relevance order 31.To conduct our scalability experiments  , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1. Our parallel LDA code was implemented in C++.This readonly data service can remain untouched  , but for the sake of the explanation we split it further during the second denormalization step. The remaining tables from TPC-W are effectively read-only and are clustered into a single data service.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing. In this paper we evaluate the retrieval performance of four methods to discover missing web pages.However  , we have found little evidence  , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set  , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG. The ability of our models to take into account different levels of uncertainty for different data produces effective models  , and  , for FITC-Rank in particular  , performance is consistent across experiments and gives significant improvements against the baseline models.Although we felt that the 100GB collection would be more useful as a research tool  , we didn't have the storage capacity available to handle such a large dataset at that time. Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset  , consisting of 247 ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.Then  , for every query the system should return a ranking such that the most appropriate search engines are ranked highest without using the actual results for the given query which were  , in fact  , provided after the submission deadline of this task. The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.So parity striping has better fault containment than RAIDS designs. In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.Given the large number of pages involved  , we used automatic classification. To define user interests in a manageable way for all models  , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory  , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.Therefore it is more likely that categories make sense  , have proper labels  , and that each category has information organized in a useful way e.g.  , Craigslist postings are sorted by date. Working with pre-existing structure ensures that a human oversees the way information is organized.The validity of what remains from that execution is now in serious doubt  , since originally transactions read data items updated by T and acted accordingly  , whereas now T's operations have vanished but its indirect impact on its dependent transactions is still apparent. Given a concurrent execution of a set of transactions i.e.  , an interleaved sequence of operations compensation for one of the transactions  , T  , can be modeled as an attempt to cancel the operations of T while leaving the rest of the sequence intact.F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2. Assuming the catalog entry is still accessible and still refers to the document  , three conditions must be met in order to recover its content: 1.This is due to the fact that the concerned interactions heavily rely on queries that are rewritten to target multiple  , different data services. However  , the denormalized TPC-W fails to meet its SLA for two out of the 14 interaction types.  , and queue need to be initialized  , leaving the background ontology O p and possibly its classification information R t   , S t intact. To be precise  , we simply dump the values ofFigure 5shows the cumulative latency distributions from both sets of experiments. We selected a load of 900 EBs for TPC-W and 330 EBs for RUBBoS  , so that the tested configurations would be significantly loaded.The assumptions we make on the considered dataset are as follows. In total  , we collected around 13 ,000 spatial objects in Milano and 30 ,000 in London; those objects are instances of around 180 LinkedGeoData ontology classes our spatial features.To avoid the aforementioned implication  , these extra documents with low BM25 scores were dropped in the latest LETOR release 13. This is a highly counterintuitive outcome.As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies   , we used the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach. Table 1For the first two studies  , we recruited participants using Craigslist. We also conducted interviews with most of our user study participants   , and six additional people  , asking them how they use the web to form and promote their opinions.The nature of GP algorithms is also prone to overfitting. According to the authors  , GP based LETOR was able to achieve competitive performance with RankSVM and RankBoost  , but its computational cost is higher.We started from the 506 topics gathered for FedWeb 2013 5  , leaving out the 200 topics provided to the FedWeb 2013 participants. </narrative> </topic>This provides a consistent topical representation of page visits from which to build models. We represented interest models as a distribution across categories in the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org topical hierarchy as in 45.Low-level features include term frequency tf  , inverse document frequency idf  , document length dl  , and their combinations. Features in Letor OHSUMED dataset consists of 'low-level' features and 'high-level' features.The upper screenshot shows the initial response page list of starting points; the other three show sample content from each of the top three starting points. Figure 1 shows the output of our prototype NAR system called Volant for the query " guitar " over a community bulletin-board Web site called Craigslist Pittsburgh 2 .The approaches in the literature for event representation can be divided to two groups: The first approach describes an event in the sentence level by an intact text or individual terms 5  , 36. Illustration of more such events can be see in Figure 5.In order to handle the sheer size of the DMOZ hierarchy  , we included only the first three levels of the hierarchy in our experiments . For instance  , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee ,_Tim/.First 100 elements obtained from three different ranking methods  , tf -idf   , BM 25  , and Rejection are pair-wise compared in Figure 5. Documents in both D1 and D2 Figure 5 are drawn from dataset collection WT2G where |D1| = |D2| = 2500  , |T1| = 50961 and |T2| = 127487.These long requests are often kept running because the number of such requests is small  , and derived results can be cached for future use. For example in Ask.com search site  , some uncached requests may take over one second but such a query will be answered quickly next time from a result cache.Very few text analysis tools can  , for example  , deal with different confidence values in their input  , apart from the extensive standardization these would require for the input/output formats and interpretation of these values. For task T4 not in the table  , the use of OCRed texts in other tools  , our findings are also mainly negative.A static cache determines items to be cached based on previous usage statistics and keeps the cache content intact until the next periodic update. The caching strategies can be broadly categorized as either static or dynamic 9.First  , the transactions and atomic sets of the TPC-W workload impose the creation of four sets of transactions whose targeted data do not overlap. Its database contains 10 tables that are queried by 6 transactions  , 2 atomic sets  , 6 UDI queries that are not part of a transaction  , and 27 read-only queries.To illustrate the effects of some of these design considerations figure 1shows three precision curves obtained using the WT2g collection and short queries. To be more concrete  , we present next some of the precision vs. pruning results using standard MAP and P@10 measures.This latter question is a matter of some interest  , as the MAP scores for LETOR 3 approach the 65% considered achievable with human-adjudicated relevance 5. So the meta-learner constitutes the best known method  , and the result raises the lower bound of what is known to be learnable from the dataset.Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success. Zhu  , Kraut  , and Kittur 2014 examine community survival as a function of multiple memberships within Wikia communities.Although it is the responsibility of the Sender to inform the Receiver of his doubt  , an intact communication within the team of the Receiver can help to recognize the mistake Fig. 4  , Requirement 15.As we will see in the next section   , the throughput improvements that GlobeTP provides are significantly greater for TPC-W than RUBBoS. However  , the latency and the throughput of a given system are not necessarily correlated.Craigslist. We choose a random document  , edit the contents and preview the modified document.regression trees on large data sets  , since the required tree depth grows with increasing data set size. We observe up to 25 fold speedups in this distributed setting for the Microsoft LETOR data set.In comparison with their original publication   , the FedWeb submission assumed that all resources are of the same size. As these were not available  , document samples were used instead.It is used for measuring the system throughput. The primary metric of the TPC-W benchmark is WIPS  , which refers to the average number of Web Interactions Per Second completed .The official evaluation results of JNLPBA 4 and BioCreative 2004 5 show that the state-of-the-art performances are between 70%-85% varying with different evaluation measures. NER in biomedical domain has attracted the attention of numerous researchers in resent years.We have extended the ontology of LinkedGeoData by the appropriate classes and properties. In 16  , we have created an information model as well  , which is related to the research question 2b.We use what is effectively the current standard workload generator for e-commerce sites  , TPC-W 31  , 43 . When evaluating Web server performance  , a workload generator is frequently used to drive the system in a hopefully representative manner.Orkut: This graph represents the Orkut social network. We consider better  , in terms of quality  , those algorithms that have better matching with the gold standard  , independently of the type of algorithm under consideration.We evaluate the three strategies of generating resource representations as discussed in Section 2.2  , with varying numbers of topics K in training the LDA topic model. Table 1shows the results obtained by evaluating our resource selection approaches on the FedWeb 2013 collection.Note that streams for synthetic data differs from NASDAQ data in terms of the lag and the missing update distributions. The stream generation process is as follows: A stream would pick elements of the Z vector sequentially and could perform the following three operations: a Simulate missing update: Ignore the picked element and move to the next element with Bernouilli probability = pmiss k   , b Simulate independent error: Add Gaussian noise with precision Œ≤ k > 1  , c Simulate Lag: Publish the noisy update after lag governed by Uniform distribution in the range 1 ‚àí 10.Rare exceptions like the new Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact . entity.Since RAID has an inlinite MlTF for disk errors  , there are no crashes which leave disk data unreadable. To recover from a crash where the disk is intact  , one need only abort all transactions alive at the time of the failure  , an instantaneous operation.We stopped at that point as 50 ,000 EBs is the maximum throughput that our TPC-W implementation reaches when we use the entire DAS-3 cluster for hosting the complete application. We believe that all the data services can easily be scaled further.Note that we did not use the public LETOR data 15  , because the numbers of queries in the datasets are too small to conduct meaningful experiments on query dependent ranking. All the methods tested in this section are based on the same feature set.for all selected LinkedGeoData classes. We compute the Morishita and the Moran indexes for all spatial features  , i.e.An exception was BROOF gradient which converged at about 100 iterations for the largest datasets. On average  , our strategies converge at about 15 iterations on the LETOR datasets  , and around 5 to 10 iterations on the multi-relevance judgment datasets.It is a graph  , where each user corresponds to a vertex and each user-to-user connection is an edge. Orkut is a large social networking website.The first evaluation is based on the LETOR datasets 17  , which include manual relevance assessments. The rankers are compared using the metric rrMetric 3.The main advantage of n-grams over tokens is the capability to detect subwords such as " watch "   , without requiring an explicit list of valid terms. For example  , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "   , " llwat "   , " lwatc "   , " watch "   , " atche "   , " tcher " and " chers "   , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.We thus examined whether tapping the co-commenting patterns of a user's friends can help improve our personalized recommendation for the user. Furthermore  , the Newsvine friendship relations are publicly crawlable.Samples were composed following the allocation plan sketched above Section 2.1  , whereby strata are represented in the sample largely in accordance with their full-collection proportions. The operative unit for stratification was the message  , and messages were assigned intact parent email together with all attachments to strata.Singhal and Kaszkiel 4 looked at average in-and out-links  , within and across hosts  , between the smaller WT2g corpus and their own large crawl. To answer that  , we first need to understand more about what the web looks like.TPC-W defines three standard workload mixes that exercise different parts of the system: 'browsing' generates 5% update interactions; 'shopping' generates 20% update interactions; and 'ordering' generates 50% update interactions. Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.P2 explicitly stated that while he did publish results based on quantitative methods in the past  , he would not use the same methods again due to the potential of technology-induced bias. We asked P1  , P2 and P4 about the possibilities of more quantitative tools on top of the current digital archive  , and in all cases the interviewees' response was that no matter what tools were added by the archive  , they were unlikely to trust any quantitative results derived from processing erroneous OCRed text.NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact. In Section 8  , all effectiveness measures except NDCG treat judgments of 1 and 2 as relevant.This paper reports on large-scale experiments with four different approaches to rank travel destination recommendations at Booking.com  , a major online travel agent. The resulting test collection can be used to evaluate destination and venue recommendation approaches.They may be classified as distinct documents by some users  , and duplicates by some others. Similarly  , a digital document may exist in different media types  , such as plain text  , HTML  , I&TEX  , DVI  , postscript  , scanned-image  , OCRed text  , or certain PC-a.pplication format.Traditional benchmark databases  , such as Wieconein and AS3AP  , are primarily geared toward8 performance assessment of the algorithm8 in relation to the architecture . The experiment8 foreseen require care in the design and population of the test databases.The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014. Though classification of resources into verticals was available  , our system did not make use of them.The assessors checked the number of relevant documents in the Web collection once they had a candidate topic from searching the ad hoc collection. NIST assessors referred to the WT2g collection during the process of ad hoc topic generation.The evaluation was structured as follows: Only URLs identified by the " r:resourcE' tag were considered. We use the pages chosen by the Open Database Project ODP -see http://dmoz.org.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents  , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data. The Disk1&2  , Disk4&5 collection contains newswire articles from various sources  , such as Association Press AP  , Wall Street Journal WSJ  , Financial Times FT  , etc.  , which are usually considered as high-quality text data with little noise.Furthermore  , the Newsvine friendship relations are publicly crawlable. As mentioned in Section 4  , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.Overlap and Distance features will capture this splitting and reordering. c The phrase " do not contain 834 " is kept intact in P 1   , but is split apart in P 2 .In WPBench  , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications. Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.The key ingredient in applications for which the ACID properties are too strict is interaction. Early work kept the basic principles of the model intact   , while adding nesting Mos87  , BBG89  or exploiting commutativity properties of a general set of database operations as opposed to simply read and write Kor83  , BR92  , Weiss.For such atomic sets  , only the columns that are updated must be local to the same data service to be able to provide atomicity. Atomic sets appear  , for example  , in TPC-W  , where a query that reads the content of a shopping cart and the one that adds another element must be executed atomically 34.The key point of our recovery paradigm is that we would like to leave the effects of the dependent transactions intact while preserving the consistency of the database  , when undoing the compensated-for transaction. of T  , and are referred to as a set using the notation depT.The results also suggest that query terms are valuable information for sake of ranking. Experimental results  , obtained using the LETOR benchmark  , indicate that methods that learn to rank at query-time outperform the state-ofthe-art methods.We use the 5-fold cross validation partitioning from LETOR 10. The optimal parameters for the final GBRT model are picked using cross validation for each data set.Section 5 evaluates SERT with application benchmarks from Ask.com. Section 4 describes our implementation.The category Microsoft has a homonymous page  , categorized under Companies listed on NASDAQ which has the head lemma companies. An example is provided in Figure 2.Finally  , Section 8 discusses the related work and Section 9 concludes the paper. Section 7 presents the relative performance of GlobeDB and different edge service architectures for the TPC-W benchmark.Finally  , " STW " scalable TPC-W represents the denormalized TPC-W with scalability techniques enabled . We then compare its performance to " DTW "   , which represents the denormalized TPC-W where no particular measure has been taken to scale up individual services.As in the prior studies  , we label the results visited by users across their long-term search histories using category labels from the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org. The features used for the personalization include long-term click behavior and topical classifications of the clicked results  , both similar to those shown to be effective in previous work on personaliza- tion 278.Note that  , this pre-defined hard categorization can also be used to improve ranking by applying the same method in Section 3.3. The statistics of queries for three categories in LETOR 3.0 can be found in 16.From the work of Kleinberg in 7  , it is generally accepted that for queries on broad topics  , Connectivity Analysis will allow for the selection of the most popular densely linked documents from within a WWW community in response to a query  , in addition to automatic result clustering. We do suggest caution being taken when reviewing the Small Web Task to take the results in the context of the WT2g dataset  , lest one conclude that Connectivity Analysis does not improve precision in any case.We varied the load from 140-2500 Emulated Browsers EB. Note that we have modified the TPC-W load generator to add request timeouts and think time between successive retries of a blocked request.Each performance value on test sets shown in the figures is averaged using five-fold cross validation as the same way used in LETOR. By varying Œ≤ from 0 to 1 with a step of 0.05  , the curves of the ranking performance of FocusedRank in terms of Œ∫-NDCG 4 and Œ∫-ERR are shown in Figure 1and Figure 2.Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR. Multiple LETOR methods have been tried  , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.This section presents various digital resources of each scanned volume  , selection of input for the metadata generation system  , the method for automatic metadata generation  , and the set of metadata elements generated by the system. Finally  , generated metadata information and OCRed text are integrated to support navigation and retrieval of content within scanned volumes.Friendster 1 and Orkut 2 are among the earliest and most successful SNSs. As a kind of online application  , SNSs are useful to register personal information including a user's friends and acquaintances on these systems; the systems promote information exchange such as sending messages and reading Weblogs.Then  , we discuss our first two approaches  , which are relatively straightforward and mainly used for comparison: the random ranking of destinations Section 2.2  , and the list of the most popular destinations Section 2.3. We first discuss our baseline  , which is the current production system of the destination finder at Booking.com.We deployed the TPC-W benchmark in the edge servers. A similar setup to emulate a WAN was used in 15.One reason for the ubiquity of Orkut is most likely due to the power of influencers and the practice of account gifting. Contrasting the social stigma in America where only young people are perceived to use popular social networks  , Orkut is part of society in Brazil  , as it is not only used by teenagers  , but parents  , relatives  , and even taxi drivers as well.The out-links file consisted of  , for each document d  , the document numbers of the documents d links to. Accordingly  , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.Our study design was driven by several features that we discovered in this massive corpus. For scanned articles  , per-article metadata such as titles  , issue dates  , and boundaries between articles are also derived algorithmically from the OCRed data  , rather than manually curated.As another example  , in case the program can not recognize the volume and issue number due to OCR error  , such as " IV " was OCRed as " it "   , the program will use the previous or the following title page information  , if available  , to construct the current volume or issue metadata. For instance  , in order to tolerate OCR errors in volume and issue number line  , we set the Levenshtein Distance20 between an examined string and the target " volume " and " issue " keywords as a parameter and choose the optimal value based on experiments. LETOR: Using only statistical features associated with matched terms features L1‚àí10 and H1‚àí3 in Tab. 1.We started by identifying all the distinct hosts represented in the 100 gigabyte collection. The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.One area where none of the standards provided duced above was far from trivial. Some users are interested in highly unstructured text data OCRed from field journals  , or more conventional relational tables of data  , so BigSur does not require that these super-classes are used.The bins were then distributed to first-pass assessors who  , equipped with detailed assessment guidelines largely compiled from the relevance guidance that the Topic Authority had provided the teams in the course of the exercise  , assessed the documents in their bins for relevance to their assigned topics. Some bins had more  , some less  , than 500 documents  , due to the fact that messages were assigned to bins intact parent email together with all attachments  , making it impossible to see that every bin had exactly 500 documents.The TPC-W application uses a database with seven tables   , which are queried by 23 read and 7 UDI templates. These servers are connected to each other with a gigabit LAN  , so the network latency between the servers is negligible. LETOR: For comparison purposes  , a LETOR-like document selection methodology is also employed. Hedge finds many relevant documents " common " to various retrieval systems   , thus documents likely to contain many of the query words.Thus  , the results reported here refer to non-normalized data. We also tried different strategies to normalize our feature vectors  , including L2-norm  , z-score and the LETOR normalization procedure 17  , with no improvements.We present here performance evaluations of TPC-W  , which we consider as the most challenging of the three applications. On the other hand  , RUBiS requires coarser-grain update-intensive services  , but they can be scaled relatively easily.This did change the statistically significant pair found in each data set  , however. The rest of the order was preserved intact.The unavoidable inaccuracy of our cost estimations therefore generates unbalanced load across servers  , which leads to sub-optimal performance. This can be explained by the fact that in TPC-W the costs of different query templates are relatively similar.From the PSLNL documents  , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out. If pattern discovery is effective  , we would expect that most data items would be extracted.From the NCBI site  , 4032 RefSeq records linked from our MEDLINE subset and that contain gene sequences were downloaded. Only the default OAI metadata format  , oai_dc  , is available for each OAI item.For instance  , the most popular of these services  , Wikia 2   , has more than three thousand collections  , some of them with more than fifty thousand documents. These services host large numbers of collections  , focused on subjects as diverse as geographical information  , sports  , technology   , science  , TV shows  , fiction  , events  , and books  , to cite only a few.The criteria for relevance in the context of CTIR are not obvious. NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.To evaluate the system performance  , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in Figure 2 . At the same time  , we want to see if our system throughput is competitive with a traditional centralized architec- ture.Burstiness in request arrivals results in the phenomenon of persistent " bottleneck switch " where performance measures are counter-intuitive  , e.g.  , user SLOs are grossly violated while performance measures such as device utilizations are moderate 3. The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system.Compensation undoes T's effects in a semantic manner  , rather than by physically restoring a prior state. The key point of our recovery paradigm is that we would like to leave the effects of the dependent transactions intact while preserving the consistency of the database  , when undoing the compensated-for transaction.The test for basic functionality at Craigslist uses the browser to browse advertisements in the San Francisco bay area sfbay.craigslist.org. Craigslist has different sites based on geographic location and is similar to newspaper classified ads.It requires that if the inventory of an object is 0  , users requesting this object must be notified that delivery may take longer than normal e.g. To examine consistency constraints beyond that of the standard TPC-W benchmark  , our distributed-bookstore benchmark adds the constraint of a finite inventory for each item.She not only used Orkut herself but created accounts for her mother  , sister  , and brother. One of our participants  , an 18-year-old student  , was not only technologically-savvy in terms of adopting new websites and exploring advanced features of computer applications  , she was also a strong " gifter. "Experimental results manifest that RSRank not only achieves good sparsity in practice  , but also exhibits a high level of performance in comparison with several proposed baseline algorithms. Finally  , we evaluate the proposed method on LETOR 3.0 benchmark collections1.In Figure 1  , the performance variations on graded MQ2007 are represented as curves with open symbols while that on0.0 0 . Each performance value on test sets shown in the figures is averaged using five-fold cross validation as the same way used in LETOR.Since we are only training on a single topic  , resulting accuracy is far lower than what typically published LETOR results. Instead  , for each topic we train on it alone and evaluate on all other topics  , then we average this over all topics.We opt for leaving the fully utilized instances intact as they already make good contributions. The idle instances are preferred candidates to be shut down.We now turn to study the scalability of each data service individually . We stopped at that point as 50 ,000 EBs is the maximum throughput that our TPC-W implementation reaches when we use the entire DAS-3 cluster for hosting the complete application.In Ranking SVM plus relation  , we make use of both content information and relation information. Actually  , the results of Ranking SVM are already provided in LETOR.His visual fields are intact. Neurological: He is awake and alert.We divide our experiments into two parts. The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation.See Figure 4for an example of the results generated by a query "Vegetable Soup Recipes". Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines. To test the correctness of our SVM ranking algorithm and the correctness of the feature extractor we extracted features from the Million Query 2008 collection  , and performed a five-fold cross validation.We focused on a service called destination finder where users can search for suitable destination based on preferred activities. This paper reports on large-scale experiments with four different approaches to rank travel destination recommendations at Booking.com  , a major online travel agent. The DjVu XML file presents logical structures of the OCRed text. We choose the DjVu XML 2 file as the main input of the metadata generation system for several reasons:  The DjVu XML file contains full OCRed text.Unfortunately  , the LDA based topic mining approach has failed in this task. And we hopped to be able to generate weighted distribution of words that could potentially identify multiple topics of a query from the top ranked documents  , and by using these approximations of multiples topics  , we can perform multiple searches for the same query with different expansions  , followed by separate LETOR for each expanded query  , and eventually merge the results with data fusion.The latter is typical in our case because the scores generate by different LETOR algorithms are different in terms of scale and rank-score curves. Many previous studies on Data fusion 17 18 19 suggested that when the scores of the systems to be combined are commensurable   , using score based fusion methods are better than using only the rank positions  , but when the scores are incompatible or if the systems generate different rank-score curves  , rank based fusion techniques are better.Hotels show various inconsistencies within and across hosting sites. In the reminder of the paper  , we will use HDC for Hotels .com  , TA for TripAdvisor.com and BDC for Booking.com.Section 6 summarizes related work. Section 5 evaluates SERT with application benchmarks from Ask.com.These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection  , which has  , by construction  , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset. We see that the best resource depending on the queries from the General search engines achieves the highest number of relevant results and/or the results with the highest levels of relevance  , followed by the Blogs  , Kids  , and Video verticals.Also  , data mining for high-level behavioral patterns in a diachronous  , heterogeneous  , partially- OCRed corpus of this scale is quite new  , precedented on this scale perhaps only by 8 which brands this new area as " culturomics " . We list them here to explain our study design.In both experimental setups  , i.e.  , the LETOR and WSDM setup  , both BARACO and MT have good performance in most cases and high agreement with the ground truth. The estimated difference between rankers is strongly correlated with the ground truth in the WSDM dataset  , suggesting that both methods can estimate the difference between rankers well given the logged user interactions with the production ranker.In calculation of MAP  , we viewed 'definitely' and 'partially relevant' as relevant. Figure 4shows the results on Letor OHSUMED dataset in terms of MAP and NDCG  , averaged over five trials.Runs are ordered by decreasing CF-IDF score. nDCG@20  nDCG@10  nP@1  nP@5  uiucGSLISf2 0Figure 1: Per-topic nDCG@20 and nDCG@10 for both FedWeb RS runs.Table 7: Optimal hyper-parameter on all retrieval methods over both types of verbose queries tuned for MAP on WT2g. Figure 2: Performance trend MAP as the single smoothing hyper-parameter Œª  , ¬µ  , and œâ changes for each language model on the WT2g tuning collection for description only queries top and for description and narrative queries bottom.Topic: We utilize the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org  , a human-generated hierarchical taxonomy of Websites  , as our topical ontology. When we failed to identify the location of a user  , we categorize their location as " other " .Thei_titlefieldoftheitemtablewasgeneratedusing the TPC-W WGEN utility. We used the TPC-W search-by-title workloadforminFigure2andqueriesasinFigure4.Even assuming that these slow algorithms scale linearly with the problem size  , which is not true for most of them  , the analysis of large graphs may require unaffordable times. Oslom takes several days to analyze the Orkut graph whereas SCD finds the communities in a few minutes.With LETOR data  , since HP and NP are similar tasks but TD is rather different  , we conducted experiments on HP03- to-NP04 and NP03-to-TD04 adaptation  , where the former setting is for adapting to a similar domain and the latter for adapting to a distinct one. The free parameters Œªs and Œªt were set such that Œªs Œªt is inversely proportional to |Ds| |Dt|Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content. The first 75% are selected as training documents and the rest are test documents.They experimented with a baseline run utTailyM400  , and a variation using a Gaussian distribution instead of a Gamma distribution utTailyNormM400. In comparison with their original publication   , the FedWeb submission assumed that all resources are of the same size.We crawled 1 ,546 ,441 Webpages from ODP which spanned over 172 ,565 categories. The taxonomy we used in the paper is from Open Directory Project ODP  , http://dmoz.org/.In Table 5 we report the percentage of mean average precision achieved by each bilingual run performed with intact translation resources when pre-translation expansion was not used. A baseline of English monolingual performance is shown in Table  4  , for the three query forms title-only or T  , title+description or TD  , and title+description+narrative or TDN with and without the application of pseudo relevance feedback.Similar figures are seen for other workload mixes of TPC-W. Similarly  , about 80% of accesses to the customer tables use simple queries.Thus  , the problem to be solved in this paper is to develop flexible techniques for discovering patterns in PSLNL documents. 4 and is not applicable here.The system can be inserted in many contexts  , including situations where the original files do not support annotations or must remain intact  , as in a digital preservation environment. These features don't require modification of the original documents or impose further restrictions  , and thus can be adopted without any additional infrastructures.Our evaluations assume that the application load remains roughly constant  , and focus on the scalability of denormalized applications. We present here performance evaluations of TPC-W  , which we consider as the most challenging of the three applications.We then combine page features and line features for volume level and issue level metadata generation. During the parsing of the XML file  , the system calculates features for every word  , line  , paragraph  , and page of the OCRed text.The value of entities updated by both T and its dependents should reflect only the dependents' updates. The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .This hierarchy is pre-generated using the open directory project dmoz http://dmoz.org to classify various web pages. Query category is decided based on classification of each possible keyword query into a two-level query type hierarchy.We highlight our contributions and key results below. In our study  , we use more than 15M reviews from more than 3.5M users spanning three prominent travel sites  , Tripadvisor   , Hotels.com  , Booking.com spanning five years for each site.Many of such features cannot be easily integrated in the formulae of conventional retrieval models due to lack of theoretical foundations. One advantage of LETOR is that it allows incorporating features that addresses various characteristics of a document and its relevance to a topic.Importantly  , data denormalization does not imply any loss in terms of consistency or transactional properties. We applied this methodology to three standard benchmark applications and showed that it allows TPC-W  , the most challenging of the three  , to scale by at least an order of magnitude compared to master-slave database replication.If the structure remains intact  , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree. Usually  , when a web page changes  , either the structure of the document or its content remains largely unchanged.We discuss other similar work in Section 5 and summarize our work in Section 6. In Section 4  , we conduct experiments with the TPC-W benchmark workload  , primarily targeting system availability  , performance   , and consistency.were detailed earlier in this document. Figure 3below shows the precision at 5 -1000 documents returned from running the modified queries on WT2g.The evidence strongly suggests that " bank of america " should be a segment. In these examples  , although there are variations in the query words and documents  , the sub-sequence " bank of america " remains intact in all clicked documents.The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system. Client requests may cycle between the front and back-end database servers before they are returned to the client.The performance of runs is measured by the nDCG@20  , which is the main evaluation metric used at the FedWeb research selection task. The " engines " column shows the results of the runs generated using the big-document strategy; " search " column is about all the runs generated by the snippetbased big-document strategy; and " docs " column presents the results of the runs generated by the small-document strategy.An  list  , and leave the original node intact except changing its timestamp . Information for this result can be found in 8.We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW  , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W. We expect that using more resources the curve would grow faster again up to the point where the small data services need four servers.Such query-independent factors are orthogonal to our approach  , so combination of the two could probably further improve the performance. The good performance of their runs largely depends on a queryindependent prior ranking of the resources learned on the results from FedWeb 2013.This is in the spirit of the Slice heuristics keeping slices intact and at the same time gives the biggest hope to minimize the total number of database resets. As a consequence  , T 5 is executed on M 1 .And we hopped to be able to generate weighted distribution of words that could potentially identify multiple topics of a query from the top ranked documents  , and by using these approximations of multiples topics  , we can perform multiple searches for the same query with different expansions  , followed by separate LETOR for each expanded query  , and eventually merge the results with data fusion. Originally  , this was performed after the first pass when most of the relevant documents are assumed to be retrieved by using BM25 and Indri with pseudo relevance feedback .Figure 4shows the results on Letor OHSUMED dataset in terms of MAP and NDCG  , averaged over five trials. We conducted 5-fold cross validation experiments  , following the guideline of Letor.They learn multiple ranking models for each of these clusters where they incorporate the notion of freshness into the traditional letor approach by generating hybrid labels based on relevance and freshness judgments similar to Dong et al. The clustering employed is a soft-clustering where each query is associated with all the clusters with different association weights.Program states will be kept intact across web interactions; 4. Values obtained from web input will be well typed; 3.This was a fine grained evaluation where  , unless our WSD system assigned the exact associated gold standard tag contained in Brown2 to a word instance  , it was marked as wrong. To provide a benchmark for the performance of our automated WSD system we used it to disambiguate the Brown2 part of Semcor.Given the large number of pages involved  , we used automatic classification. To address this challenge  , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory  , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.The classifier has a micro-averaged F1 value of 0.60 and is described more fully in reference 5 . To identify topical category  , we use automatic query classification into the top two levels of the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org hierarchy .The topics were assigned to pages based on their content using a text-based classifier described and evaluated in 6. Topic labels were taken from the 219 topics from the top two levels of the Open Directory Project ODP  , http://dmoz.org  , and included topics such as " Health/Medicine " and " Recreation/Sports " .For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 24 and the recently published MSLR-WEB10K data set from Microsoft Research 1. All three data sets are pre‚Äìfolded and come with evaluation scripts that allow fair comparison of different ranking algorithms.Two OAI metadata formats are provided for each OAI item: refseq: contains the refseq records in our refseq XML format. Hence  , we created a simple RefSeq XML schema for the RefSeq OAI repository 2.For each query or document  , we keep the top three topics returned by the classifier. dmoz.org.The coordination mechanism allows an additional filter to be added to filter out the sidebars and footers  , and to return only the pure article text. For example  , most of the 10 news sites  , which are used for the current GeoTopics  , have sidebars and footers in their articles  , which cause falsematching problems e.g.  , 'NASDAQ' was ranked high because it is appeared on the side bars in many of the news articles.Combining each time different subsets to make the training  , the validation and the test set  , the LETOR authors create 5 different arrangements for five-fold cross validation. In LETOR  , data is partitioned in five subsets.After code is checked in for the first time  , subsequent 'check-in's need to store only the changes from last checkin . Nevertheless  , the identity of program entities remains intact even after refactoring operations.This simple implementation meets our system design priorities. In particular  , TPC-W benchmark defines the catalog update operations as 0.11% of all operations in the workload.This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted  , left intact or deleted. There are two constraints on S. The first states that ‚àÄxi P y j ‚ààT ‚à™{Œª} Syj|xi = 1.However more notably it outperforms bare frequency tagging by 8.2%. SUDS overall accuracy is reported at 62.1% when evaluated using the Brown2 part of SemCor  , this is representative of the current state of the art systems2.This is a proxy since the AppServs processes do not report they have finished " waking-up " as it was the case for the regular startup JBoss reports the startup time. We use the completion of a small application request the home page of TPC-W to indicate that the application instance is active.Even though some of these instances might not be required for running some of our applications  , they represent an important and resourceful part of the KB and can be considered as a type of ontology use  , and hence it was deemed important to make sure that all these instances remain intact. Figure 1gives some idea on how sparsely instantiated the AKTRO is in our repository.We use the validation set to decide which kernels to use in the transductive system. Following LETOR convention  , each dataset is divided into 5 folds with a 3:1:1 ratio for training  , validation  , and test set.Both hedge and LETOR-like document selection methodology   , by design  , select as many relevant documents as possible . Furthermore   , when relevant and non-relevant documents in the training data set are very similar to each other  , performance of the resulting ranking functions decline.A query-biased snippet is one selectively extracted on the basis of its relation to the searcher's query. They may be static for example  , always show the first 50 words of the document   , or the content of its description metadata  , or a description taken from a directory site such as dmoz.org or query-biased 20.This design also allowed for a clear separation between architectural and system-level concerns. The design of the middleware's architectural support recall Figure 3 remained intact as we ported it from Java to C++.Since the first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine website we could not obtain any click data that can validate which uncommented stories were actually viewed by a user. As shown in Table 2  , this dataset contains 25 ,527 articles with 1 ,664 ,917 comments and 320 ,425 users.the LETOR benchmark 5 requires only one parameter c as input. Since higher NDCG values are obtained when the most relevant results are ranked on the top followed by the less relevant and the irrelevant ones  , the above observation enforces our claim that our method favors the most relevant results of each query.Similar to the previous experiment  , we exercised each system configuration with increasing numbers of EBs until the SLA was violated. We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW  , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.Similarly  , a digital document may exist in different media types  , such as plain text  , HTML  , I&TEX  , DVI  , postscript  , scanned-image  , OCRed text  , or certain PC-a.pplication format. Note that  , however  , indirection duplicates are not possible with technical reports.Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.   , d -1 all the children of the old node n whose parent edge weight was congruent to i mod d.In this dataset each title gets one " signatureword "  ,andeachsignaturewordisinserted intoanaverageoffivetitles.ThesearchstringinaTPC- W query is a signature word. Thei_titlefieldoftheitemtablewasgeneratedusing the TPC-W WGEN utility.The first query craigslist is stereotypically navigational  , showing a spike at the " correct " answer www.craigslist.org. For each example  , we plot the percentage of clickthroughs against position for the top ten results.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications. While there exist many bibliographic utilities comprehensive list e.g.Despite the increased performance  , TPC-W cannot fully utilize the web server's computational resources cf. In Setup B  , the maximal throughput of the benchmark increased to 2200 req/s Curve 3 in Figure 5a.The undecidability remains intact in the absence of attributes with a finite domain. The undecidability can be verified by reduction from the implication problem for standard FDs and INDs.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 . We proceed to describe how each of the datasets was obtained and preprocessed.Nevertheless  , in a setup similar to LETOR setup  , as in our experiments  , we show that substantially less documents than the ones used in LETOR can lead to similar performance of the trained ranking functions. Therefore  , in the case where hundreds of raw features are employed  , ranking functions may need more than 1% of the complete collection to achieve optimal performance.In the experiment we used data obtained from a commercial search engine. Note that we did not use the public LETOR data 15  , because the numbers of queries in the datasets are too small to conduct meaningful experiments on query dependent ranking.Nick Craswell developed software for extracting hyper-link connectivity information from WT2g. It is not known at this stage  , what proportion of the dead links those whose target lies outside WT2g are inter-server links and how many are references to same-server pages which happen to be missing from the VLC2 1 .This is also known as soft thresholding and its application to the wavelet representation is known as wavelet shrinkage. perform thresholding is to shrink each retained coefficient towards zero  , rather than keeping them intact.The data driver of each edge server maintains three tables. In TPC-W  , updates to a database are always made using simple query.We therefore use RR-QID for measurements of TPC-W  , and costbased routing for RUBBoS. In the following experiments we restrict ourselves to the most effective routing policy for each application.Firstly  , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory  , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org. Two of the four evaluation metrics used in our study‚Äîcoverage  , and diversity‚Äîrequired information about page topicality and query interest.As the experiment results presented in this section will show  , GlobeDB can reduce the client access latencies for typical e-commerce applications with large mixture of reads and write operations without requiring manual configurations or performance optimizations. We chose the TPC-W benchmark and evaluated the performance of GlobeDB in comparison to other existing systems for different throughput values over an emulated wide-area network.We find that 10.4% of common hotels from Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com  , 9.3% from Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com  , exhibit significantly different rating characteristics  , which is usually a sign of suspicious behavior. There are big differences in the overall score of a hotel across different sites.We also showed an application of the proposed method in an online ad serving system for matching and ranking ads for a given Web page which indicates the applicability of the proposed algorithm in real online applications as we improved the CTR and RPM significantly in the online bucket tests. Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.The design philosophy for query construction is to leave Ithe external simplicity of keyword approaches intact  , and rely on internally complex retrieval mechanisms to transcend keyword matching algorithms. A query in CODEFINDER can consist of keywords  , category labels  , attributes  , or an example database item.how strong / often are " new york times " and " subscription " associated and the application e.g.  , whether query segmentation is used for query understanding or document retrieval. For segments like new york times subscription  , the answer of whether it should be left intact as a compound concept or further segmented into multiple atomic concepts depends on the connection strength of the components i.e.Our primary purpose at this stage in our research is to check whether our basic hypothesis  , that words that tend to cohere spatially also tend to bear content  , is valid. Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results  , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.2007URLs. For simplicity we randomly sampled 300 websites from dmoz.org as our initial set of URLs.Client requests may cycle between the front and back-end database servers before they are returned to the client. Our focus is on effective resource allocation in multi-tiered systems  , and we assume an architecture such as the one used by the TPC-W benchmark  , a standard benchmark that is routinely used for capacity planning of e-commerce systems and that consists of a front server hosting a web server and an application server  , and a back-end database.We use rule-based approach for title detection using page and line features calculated from OCRed text  , bounding box information  , and context analysis. In terms of the mapping between page index  , the index of a scanned page in the viewable PDF file  , and page number  , the number printed on the original volume  , the program recognizes available page numbers on scanned pages by analyzing the OCRed text in particular areas of pages.The results on seven datasets in LETOR 3.0 show that the NDCG-Annealing algorithm can outperform the baselines and it is more stable. We compare the NDCG-Annealing algorithm with linear ranking function described in section 3 with baselines provided in the LETOR 3.0 datasets.To safeguard user privacy  , all user and community data were anonymized as performed in 17. Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.To define user interests in a manageable way for all models  , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory  , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org. For each context trail extracted from the logs  , we created a user interest model for   , the interaction context   , and the other contextual variants collection  , historic  , task  , and social.We also tried different strategies to normalize our feature vectors  , including L2-norm  , z-score and the LETOR normalization procedure 17  , with no improvements. Using cross-validation in V  , we also varied cost j between 10 ‚àí3 and 10 3   , finding that the best choice was j=100  , in most cases.If the content remains unchanged  , the hashes will still match at the root. If the structure remains intact  , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.This paper investigates strategies to recommended travel destinations for users who provided a list of preferred activities at Booking.com  , a major online travel agent. 'London'  , provides the review riuj  , d k  as: riuj  , d k  = 0  , 1  , 0.This service incurs a database update each time a client updates its shopping cart or does a purchase. The denormalized TPC-W contains one update-intensive service: the Financial service.By obtaining evidence that our samples are faithful  , we avoid processing large Web crawls  , although even our sampling experiments have fetched almost 16 million pages. We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in ¬ß2.On the other hand  , the boosting method is highly dependent on the ranking of the resources  , as we observe when a better resource selection method is used BM25 desc in FedWeb 2013 or the hybrid run in FedWeb 2012. This suggests that  , when the resource ranking is not good the performance of the hybrid method in resource selection is far from optimal  , the diversification approach seems to help a little bit.This can be explained by the fact that in TPC-W the costs of different query templates are relatively similar. In TPC-W  , the RR-QID query routing policy delivers better performance than its cost-based counterpart.Many PSLNL documents contain lists of items e.g. The discovery strategy is based on observations of typical documents.In this paper  , 3 http://dmoz.org/ SocialPageRank is proposed to explore static ranking from social annotations and capture the preference of web annotators. PageRank utilizes the link structure of the Web and measures the quality of a page from the page creator's point of view  , while fRank utilizes content-layout and user click-though information and captures the preference of both page authors and search engine users.We present our parallelization framework of LDA in Section 4 and an empirical study on our Orkut data set in Section 5. In Section 3  , we show how ARM and LDA can be adapted for the community recommendation task.Finally  , we offer our concluding remarks in Section 6. We present our parallelization framework of LDA in Section 4 and an empirical study on our Orkut data set in Section 5.More in particular  , only results from the top 20 highest ranked resources in the selection run were allowed in the merging run. An important new condition in the Results Merging task  , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task  , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.Table 1summarizes the properties of these data sets. For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 24 and the recently published MSLR-WEB10K data set from Microsoft Research 1.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links. First a connectivity server was made available on the Web.As mentioned above  , we maintain a KB with a large number of instantiations made against the AKTRO. Even though some of these instances might not be required for running some of our applications  , they represent an important and resourceful part of the KB and can be considered as a type of ontology use  , and hence it was deemed important to make sure that all these instances remain intact.It turned out that ruling out terms Figure 1 : MAP and P@10 for short queries at different pruning levels  , baseline and different settings WT2g collection   , as those terms have a negative score for every document.The table shows clearly that while the greedy and na¬®ƒ±vena¬®ƒ±ve approach achieve similar runtimes on the LinkedGeoData fragment with 1 ,000 resources  , the greedy clustering approach is orders of magnitude slower than the na¬®ƒ±vena¬®ƒ±ve approach in all other cases. Table 1.The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact. Moreover the system can easily be extended to support other data sources only by adding support for the protocol used to communicate with the source.All reported data points are averages over the four cluster nodes. The largest data sets is composed of a portion of pages referenced from ODP directory at http://dmoz.org.SEARCHING FOR PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS IN THE TPC-W BENCHMARK We use the TPC-W Benchmark 24 for evaluation of our approach. IV.The number of deterministic and probabilistic tuples is in millions. All performance experiments use the TPC-H data set with a probabilistic schema containing uncertainty in the part  , orders  , customer  , supplier  w/P are in Gb.However  , it was more convenient for us to download the most up-todate original OpenStreetMap data about Bremen  , available as Shapefiles 10 . OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .The statistics showed that the vast majority of URIs contained a title and in only 1.1% of all cases no title could be discovered. To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10  , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service  , Wookieepedia  , about the Starwars universe. In this article  , we refer to this sample as WPEDIA.Table 1shows the statistics of the datasets included in the LETOR 3.0 benchmark. For these datasets  , there are 64 features extracted for each query-document pair and a binary relevance judgment for each pair is provided.Note that we have modified the TPC-W load generator to add request timeouts and think time between successive retries of a blocked request. shtml.The newspaper data set made available to us ranges from 1618 to 1995 4 and consists of more than 102 million OCRed newspaper items. We used the default Snowball stemmer for Dutch 6 .Still  , the results also show that a better clustering of tasks as performed by greedy clustering leads to higher hit ratios  , thus suggesting that clustering alone can already be beneficial for improving the scheduling of link discovery tasks. The table shows clearly that while the greedy and na¬®ƒ±vena¬®ƒ±ve approach achieve similar runtimes on the LinkedGeoData fragment with 1 ,000 resources  , the greedy clustering approach is orders of magnitude slower than the na¬®ƒ±vena¬®ƒ±ve approach in all other cases.Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations. Our design dynamically selects termination threshold  , adaptive to load condition and performs early termination safely.32 leveraged magnetic honeypot ads to study Nigerian scams on Craigslist. Park et al.Actually  , when we use the truncated query model instead of the intact one refined from relevance feedback  , the MAP is only 0.304. This does not contradict the fact that the latter yields higher retrieval performance.Thus both clusters are left intact. The cluster .3 ,.3 ,.2 pulls the mean up but the cluster .1 ,.05 ,.05 pulls it down somewhat and thus the partition point occurs between the two clusters.There are 8 tables and 14 web interactions. TPC-W benchmark is a web application modeling an online bookstore.This context provides the hint that the user may not be interested in the search service provided by www.ask.com but instead be interested in the background information of the company. ask.com before query " Ask Jeeves " .Features in Letor OHSUMED dataset consists of 'low-level' features and 'high-level' features. In Letor  , the data is represented as feature vectors and their corresponding relevance labels .All presented NDCG  , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website. To compute P@k and MAP on the MQ datasets the relevance levels are binarised with 1 converted to 0 and 2 converted to 1.They concluded that linkage in WT2g was inadequate for web experiments. Singhal and Kaszkiel 4 looked at average in-and out-links  , within and across hosts  , between the smaller WT2g corpus and their own large crawl.MAP is then computed by averaging AP over all queries. All presented NDCG  , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website.In the above subsections  , we discussed the design of the distributed objects used in building our distributed TPC-W system. Table 1contains the summary of state replication and update propagation of each distributed object.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements. We denote such documents as partially-structured  , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.Covering these cases enables us to model queries over such data and analyze the effects of executing such queries. Another example is the LinkedGeoData project 4 which provides Linked Data about any circular and rectangular area on Earth 4.There are 106 queries in the collection. Letor OHSUMED dataset consists of articles from medical journals .Contrasting the social stigma in America where only young people are perceived to use popular social networks  , Orkut is part of society in Brazil  , as it is not only used by teenagers  , but parents  , relatives  , and even taxi drivers as well. In Brazil  , Orkut  , a popular social network  , is the most popular website in the country 3.With the increasing number of topics  , i.e. The performance of runs is measured by the nDCG@20  , which is the main evaluation metric used at the FedWeb research selection task.Since RS is written only by the tuple mover  , we expect it will typically escape damage. The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.The category of each community is defined on Orkut. The topic distributions of their Table 5: The community information for user Doe#1.This involves running the selected tool and then re-characterizing the output to both discover the technical characteristics of the new files created and to check that all the components are still present  , the relationships between them are intact and that the list of properties described above have indeed remained invariant. Once preservation planning has been completed  , the next step is then to carry out the migration.In 19  , text generation is used to study the effect of a growing collection on inverted index maintenance strategies. TPC-W 3  for example includes the WGEN program that populates the benchmark's text attributes using a static collection of words and a grammar.Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements. In our experiments the database is initially filled with 288  , 000 customer records.The FedWeb 2013 collection contains search result pages for many other queries  , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages. Participants had to rank the 157 search engines for each test topic without access to the corresponding search results.Altogether  , the need to recall queries and repeat lengthy search processes is abolished. In addition  , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions  , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.For instance  , iRefIndex consists of 13 datasets BIND  , BioGRID  , CORUM  , DIP  , HPRD  , InnateDB  , IntAct  , MatrixDB  , MINT  , MPact  , MPIDB  , MPPI and OPHID while NCBO's Bioportal collection currently consists of 100 OBO ontologies including ChEBI  , Protein Ontology and the Gene Ontology. R2 also includes 3 datasets that are themselves aggregates of datasets which are now available as one resource.SUDS overall accuracy is reported at 62.1% when evaluated using the Brown2 part of SemCor  , this is representative of the current state of the art systems2. Therefore one of the underlying assumptions behind SUDS use in IR is that query terms will rarely be seen as examples of a term being used in an infrequent sense.Hypothesis 2 was posed to provide understanding of whether teachers' varying level of teaching experience influenced the desire to customize materials versus download them intact. Teachers indicated only a slight preference for web sites that show ratings by other users or for online teaching resources they don't have to modify 3.61.Briefly  , it uses a statistical analysis of collocation  , cooccurrence and occurrence frequency in order to assign sense. The disambiguation system we used SUDS is based on a statistical language model constructed from the manually sense tagged Brown1 part of the Semcor corpus.If the NASDAQ Computer Index were further divided into software  , hardware  , services  , etc.  , one can further analyze comparisons with them. In this instance  , the computer sector has been outperformed by one of its members Apple by a large margin.Craigslist has different sites based on geographic location and is similar to newspaper classified ads. Craigslist allows users to view and post ads with very simple markup and formatting.It is easy to see that after any update  , the invariant that no trees overlap in the time dimension is preserved. Otherwise  , we leave the trees intact.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact. But the data on the other N-l discs is still available for reading and writing solving problem 2 above.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 . In the experiments we use one graph instance for each targeted application area  , i.e.  , product recommendation on shopping websites  , collaborator and patent recommendation in academia  , friend recommendation on social networks  , and personalized web search.We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year. Section 3 shows combination of the basic methods for different runs and the results will also be introduced.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 . OpenStreetMap OSM maintains a global editable map that depends on users to provide the information needed for its improvement and evolution.This is a highly counterintuitive outcome. When the LETOR collection was built  , the fact that documents with low BM25 score were selected only if they were relevant resulted in BM25 being negatively correlated with relevance in the LETOR collection.The snapshot of the Orkut network was published by Mislove et al. It is a graph  , where each user corresponds to a vertex and each user-to-user connection is an edge.If a failure  , disaster or intentional attack affects the metadata catalog  , it can cause a total data loss  , even if the data stored on the other nodes remain intact. This metadata catalog is supported by a centralized database system  , which represents a point of failure when used in the context of a preservation scenario.While our previous work 7 helped to automate database tasks related to persistence of JavaScript objects  , it did not handle the runtime state of function closures  , event-handlers  , or HTML5 media objects that we addressed in this paper related to the migration of running browser sessions. The automated and generic nature of our instrumentation makes our approach transparent and helps developers keep their original source code intact.The third priority is optimizing resource usage such as network bandwidth  , processing power  , and storage. The source code of the latest distributed TPC-W bookstore implementation is only three thousand lines more than that of the centralized version  , excluding the messaging layer implementation.Microsoft has a supercategory Computer and video game companies with the same head lemma. The category Microsoft has a homonymous page  , categorized under Companies listed on NASDAQ which has the head lemma companies.In this way we still manage to keep the sibling information intact without having to store whole levels of the tree during the traversal. Figure 2shows an example of a family order traversal.Nevertheless  , we have adapted the AS3AP benchmark to fit into our purposes. AS3AP is the ANSI SQL Standard Scaleable and Portable Benchmark for comparing relational DBMSs.We deployed the benchmark in two environments. In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies   , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.Letor OHSUMED dataset consists of articles from medical journals . In the first experiment  , we used the Letor benchmark datasets 18: OHSUMED  , TD2003  , and TD2004.For each scanned volume  , the metadata generation system takes the DjVu XML file as input and parses the hierarchy of objects contained within the file. Thus  , line features are designed to estimate properties of OCRed text within a line  , which can be calculated based on OCRed text and bounding box information in the DjVu XML file.We apply conjunctive constraints on document image components to a straightforward document ranking based on total query-word frequency in the OCRed document text; in Fig- ure 2we show document images retrieved for two such queries. We consider integrated queries that our prototype makes possible for the first time.To create features for the selection framework  , we use the published test runs 1 for these rankers to obtain the document scores for top 10 ranking documents  , and the list of 64 features that are available as part of LETOR. We use the results from three ranker baselines: Rank- Boost 5  , Regression  , and FRank 9 .5 present an empirical comparison of six measures of similarity for recommending communities to members of the Orkut social network. Spertus et al.If conflicts occur e.g.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections  , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated. Then the algorithm deletes the tuples already labeled  , repeats the same procedure for the remaining tuples  , and labels sections produced in each step as B  , C  , D and so on.The results obtained  , however  , with the FedWeb 2013 collection are completely different see Table 7. We present in the table only the best values for each of them Jelinek LM for the description field and TF-IDF for the title  and an additional method BM25 desc which will serve us as reference later.On the Microsoft LETOR data set  , we see a small decrease in accuracy  , but the speedups are even more impressive. In particular  , on Set 1 the larger data set  , our parallel algorithm  , within a matter of hours  , achieves Expected Reciprocal Rank results that are within 1.4% of the best known results 6.TD2004 have more relevant documents per topic than other LETOR collections  , relevant documents remain relatively sparse. As the histogram shows  , relevant documents per topic are quite sparse  , restricting the number of feedback iterations possible with stable evaluation.In contrast  , our work examines a fundamentally different setting where communities are actively competing with each other for users and the unique content they bring. Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success.To provide a benchmark for the performance of our automated WSD system we used it to disambiguate the Brown2 part of Semcor. Although the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of WSD in IR it was integral that we examined the accuracy of our disambiguation in isolation so that we could quantify its effects when used in our IR experiments.When evaluating Web server performance  , a workload generator is frequently used to drive the system in a hopefully representative manner. More detail on the Rice TPC-W implementation may be found at the Dynaserver Web site and in their paper 5.These data sets were chosen because they are publicly available  , include several baseline results  , and provide evaluation tools to ensure accurate comparison between methods. For meta search aggregation problem we use the LETOR 14  benchmark datasets.For evaluating the quality of a set of 10 results as returned by the resources in response to a test topic  , we use the relevance weights listed above to calculate the Graded Precision introduced by 11  as the generalized precision. These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection  , which has  , by construction  , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.This trend is an important ground for the effectiveness of MMPD. For different n and d  , the upper bound and lower bound differs from each other; however  , the trend remains intact.In this paper  , we describe an experiment using 300 randomly sampled websites from dmoz.org. Warrick was also used to recover the WWW'06 conference website when a fire destroyed the building housing the web server 25.This storage remains intact and available across system failures. The nonvolatile version of the log is stored on what is generally called stable storage e.g.  , disk.Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible  , without using any external processing engine or resources  , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit. How to optimize towards diversity under the context LETOR is yet another problem to be studied in future.We separate total running time into three parts: computation time  , communication time and synchronization time. In Table 9we report the speedup on the Orkut data set.We have considered in the same class also other wikis  , such as WackoWiki  , TikiWiki  , and OddMuse  , which support functional templating without parameter passing i.e. Actually  , full-fledged functional templating is supported only by MediaWiki and Wikia which is MediaWikibased .ask.com before query " Ask Jeeves " . However  , the vlHMM notices that the user input query " ask.com " and clicked www.The features of Letor TD2003 and TD2004 datasets include low-level features such as term frequency tf  , inverse document frequency idf  , and document length dl  , as well as high-level features such as BM25  , LMIR  , PageRank  , and HITS. Each query document pair is given a binary judgment: relevant or irrelevant.We can observe that the PLM improves performance on WT2G and FR clearly and consistently  , which shows that  , similar to general passage retrieval  , the PLM can bring added benefits to document retrieval when documents are relatively long. The results are shown in Figure 4  , where we vary the smoothing parameters for both smoothing methods on all the four data sets.An important new condition in the Results Merging task  , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task  , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run. Different evaluation measures are shown: 1. nDCG@20 official RS metric  , with the gain of duplicates set to zero see below  , and where the reference covers all results over all resources.One participant searched for " Japanese anime " Observation J3 but was only interested in videos with associated English audio  , while Participant D was interested only in Chinese content with the original audio intact. Of course  , the language of a video's audio might be altered from the original  , and whether this change has occurred can affect a video's acceptability to a given user.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR  , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file. Our intuition is that rank lists generated by point-wise methods are better at the top potions  , but the precision drops quickly if we go further down the list  , as they are prone to over-fit to certain features that are most dominating.Note that the scales of the y-axis are different across all figures. Three sample queries are shown: the " Exec Search " request  , which is relatively inexpensive with an execution time of about 400 milliseconds   , shown in Figure 11; the " Admin Response " request  , which is complex and weighs in at roughly 4.8 seconds  , shown in Fig- ure 12; and the " Average " request  , shown in Figure 13  , the average across all queries in TPC-W  , which is 425 milliseconds.In the replaying stage  , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet. Our benchmark meets all the aforementioned requirements.Example 2 shows a similar problem in a different domain. If the NASDAQ Computer Index were further divided into software  , hardware  , services  , etc.  , one can further analyze comparisons with them.In LETOR 3.0 package  , each dataset is partitioned into five for five-fold cross validation and each fold includes training   , testing and validation sets. Table 1shows the statistics of the datasets included in the LETOR 3.0 benchmark.However  , the approach leaves associations between deterministically encrypted attributes intact. 1 vertically partitions a database among two providers according to privacy constraints.The i-th record in the pointer file selects the inverted list which corresponds via the qualification to the Ds value associated with the i-th record of the original file. That is  , the original file is left intact  , and a file of pointers is added.9 schedule requests for known servlet types where each type represents a different resource need. Based on the finding that different servlets of TPC-W benchmark have relatively consistent execution time  , Elnikety et al.The LETOR-like selection achieves both high precision and recall at small percentages of data used for training up to 5% and then it drops to the levels of statAP and depth pooling. Since infAP is based on uniform random sampling  , the precision of infAP stays constant while the recall grows linearly with the sample percentage.Based on CI we provided a conceptual comparison between the different UI adaptation approaches as shown in Table 3. As for our method  , CI is always = 0 since we use runtime adaptation hence the UI representation e.g.  , HTML pages will remain completely intact at design-time.Records may be physically deleted immediately when a delete command is received or they may be flagged as deleted but left intact until garbage collection is done. Of concern is the method by which records are deleted.all the incoming and outgoing links  , and for different values of the parameter Œª  , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus Savoy 01. Fixing the parameter Œª to 0.1 and k to 5  , the final retrieval status value of D 4   , noted RSVD 4   , will be :As a second future work  , we plan use our motif framework as a way to analyze other evolving collaborative systems  , such as non- Wikimedia Wikis  , such as Wikia and Conservapedia  , which have very different editing policies and user bases. Further  , the network representation could be expanded to include editor interaction on the Talk pages  , which might reveal collaborative sequences such as Talk page discussion followed by article revision.This is because we were counting on topic modelling based query expansion to improve diversity performance  , such that we have not defined a dedicated list-wise optimization criterion on top of the rank list that addresses diversity. It is also worth noticing that even though most of these features are directly consistent to the relevance of a document to a query  , none of our LETOR methods include diversity into account .In this work  , we assume a Trusted Computing Base TCB consisting of correctly booted and functioning hardware and a correctly installed operating system and DBMS. The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.The search results from the different database systems are not combined together in any fashion and duplicate citations from different services are not eliminated. All subsequent links pass through the proxy server and are redirected to the vendor system with session connection information intact.ODP has also provided a search service which returns topics for issued queries. The topic structure defined in our poster is extracted from the top 16 categories in the ODP taxonomy http://dmoz.org.Previous work summarizes the threats that can affect the metadata catalogue 4. If a failure  , disaster or intentional attack affects the metadata catalog  , it can cause a total data loss  , even if the data stored on the other nodes remain intact.Web page classifiers based on SVM algorithm are trained beforehand for a few topics of DMOZ http://dmoz.org. In our comparative experiments  , we choose the best-first algorithm and the accelerated focused crawler 1 as two other alternatives.The largest data sets is composed of a portion of pages referenced from ODP directory at http://dmoz.org. A procedure 5 All data sets except the largest one are breadth-first crawls of sunysb.edu domain starting from http://www.sunysb.edu.In the graph  , the x-axis represents the throughput in WIPS web interactions per second  , and the y-axis represents the response time of the TPC-W application deployed on four architectures. Figure 3shows the system performance as we vary the workload.ODP is an open Web directory maintained by a community of volunteer editors. Instead  , we used the Open Directory Project ODP  , also referred to as dmoz.org.In our study  , we use more than 15M reviews from more than 3.5M users spanning three prominent travel sites  , Tripadvisor   , Hotels.com  , Booking.com spanning five years for each site. We provide True- View as a proof of concept that a cross-site analysis can significantly improve the information that the user sees.We use TPC-W benchmark  , which simulates a bookstore Web site. To this end  , we exercise an application on a hosting server with client requests  , then at some point we deallocate it  , and then re-deploy it again.In TPC-W  , the RR-QID query routing policy delivers better performance than its cost-based counterpart. In TPC-W  , GlobeTP processes 20% more queries within 10 ms than full replication.When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered  , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents  , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks  , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible  , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents  , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents. The LETOR-like selection methodology also selects very similar documents  , since the documents selected are those that give high BM25 values and thus have similar characteristics.We perform experiments on users of Booking.com where an instance of the destination finder is running in order to conduct an online evaluation. In this section we will describe our experimental setup and evaluation approach  , and the results of the experiments.The truth is  , although there are many unwanted terms in the expanded query model from feedback documents  , there are also more relevant terms than what the user can possibly select from the list of presentation terms generated with pseudo-feedback documents  , and the positive effects often outweights the negative ones. Actually  , when we use the truncated query model instead of the intact one refined from relevance feedback  , the MAP is only 0.304.By explicitly identifying the sense of a word  , the system does not have to determine the sense of the user's category annotation or query. Taking the coffee sense of the word Java  , taking a path through the DMOZ tree would give us: http://dmoz.org/../Coffee and Tea/Coffee.To identify topical category  , we use automatic query classification into the top two levels of the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org hierarchy . We hypothesized that certain topical categories of tasks are more likely to be resumed than others see also 10 .Benchmarks for system performance abound: the Transaction Processing Performance Council has defined at least 4 different benchmarks  , of which TPC-W which simulates a typical web-based e-commerce environment is perhaps the best known. A third area of autonomic system science that is worth noting is benchmarking.In detail  , in the first pass we use the standard Indri retrieval algorithm and BM25 with pseudo relevance feedback on the topby the length of the document. Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists  , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method.The classic Rocchio's model  , fails to obtain improvement on the WT2G collection. The effectiveness of pseudo relevance feedback is reconfirmed in this set of experiments.It is intended to apply to any industry that markets and sells products or services over the Internet. TPC Benchmark W TPC-W is an industry-standard transactional web benchmark that models an online bookstore 34.The integrity of a record relates to its wholeness and soundness: a record has integrity when it is essentially intact and uncorrupted. Knowledge of all these attributes is essential to establish the identity of any record.We have not yet fully exploited that ability in AQuery. Reductions help find syntactically simpler forms of an expression while keeping its semantics intact.These collection are indexed using Lucene SOLR 4.0 and we use BM25 as the retrieval model. Six collections  , relevant to the assignment about television and film personalities  , from various archives were indexed: 1 a television program collection containing 0.5M metadata records; 2 a photo collection with 20K photos of people working at television studio; 3 a wiki dedicated to actors and presenters 20K pages; 4 25K television guides that are scanned and OCRed; 5 scanned and OCRed newspapers between 1900 and 1995 6M articles; and 6 digital newspapers between 1995 and 2010 1M articles.Basic methods that we used for these tasks will be described in section 2. We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.perform thresholding is to shrink each retained coefficient towards zero  , rather than keeping them intact. Additionally  , the best way to Figure 2: Illustration of intuition  , via two simple  , extreme examples: a1‚Äì3 perturbation most resilient to any true value leaks  , and b1‚Äì3 most resilient to any linear filtering.The Wookieepedia collection provides two distinct quality taxonomies. These are the two Wikia encyclopedias with the largest number of articles evaluated by users regarding their quality.He has severe hearing loss  , but is otherwise nonfocal. His visual fields are intact.Political news flowing out of Arab Spring uprisings to broadcast media was often curated by sites such as Nawaat.org that had emerged as trusted local information brokers. Many " viral " videos take off on social media only after being featured on broadcast media  , which often follows their being highlighted on intermediary sites such as Reddit or Buzzfeed.To analyze the semantic relationships between queries  , we assign each URL to a topic distribution over 385 categories from the second level of " Open Directory Project " ODP  , dmoz.org with a contentbased classifier 18. Our proposed pairwise similarity features are list in Table 2  , and categorized into three types: query-based  , URLbased and session-based similarities.First  , we will detail our online evaluation approach and used evaluation measures. We perform experiments on users of Booking.com where an instance of the destination finder is running in order to conduct an online evaluation.As for our method  , CI is always = 0 since we use runtime adaptation hence the UI representation e.g.  , HTML pages will remain completely intact at design-time. The research work that used AOP for adapting the UI's behavior 9 Section 2.2 relied on manually creating multiple adapted UI layouts hence we also consider its v value to be > 1.18  study the TPC-W benchmark  , including its architecture   , operational procedures for carrying out tests  , and the performance metrics it generates. Garcia et al.This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection Nguyen et al.  , 2012. The relevance cut-off parameter N is set to 200.While different servlets issue different sets of queries  , any one servlet will typically issue the same set of database queries  , albeit with different parameters. For example  , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions   , each of which is embodied by a single servlet.We also use different algorithms for cost evaluation of orders. The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.In Section 4  , we conduct experiments with the TPC-W benchmark workload  , primarily targeting system availability  , performance   , and consistency. In the rest of the paper  , we first present the background information on the TPC benchmark W. Then  , in Section 3  , we discuss the design of our distributed bookstore application with the focus on the four distributed objects that enable data replication for the edge services.In our experiments the database is initially filled with 288  , 000 customer records. The TPC-W application uses a database with seven tables   , which are queried by 23 read and 7 UDI templates.Oslom takes several days to analyze the Orkut graph whereas SCD finds the communities in a few minutes. For practical purposes  , this computational complexity creates a barrier to analyze large networks by the group of slow algorithms.oai_dc: contains only the accession id in the title field to satisfy the mandatory requirement of OAI 1. Two OAI metadata formats are provided for each OAI item: refseq: contains the refseq records in our refseq XML format.This means  , for example  , that if the PageRank feature is important for the current query  , there is a good chance it will be important for other queries as well. With LETOR  , in contrast  , features capture general properties of query-document compatibility .Also  , the casual users need not feel intimidated when adding annotations as there is no risk of altering the original document. The system can be inserted in many contexts  , including situations where the original files do not support annotations or must remain intact  , as in a digital preservation environment.As presented before  , we experimented with one run based on document relevance and with three other runs depending on the output of the previous task  , that is  , a ranking of resources. On the other hand  , the boosting method is highly dependent on the ranking of the resources  , as we observe when a better resource selection method is used BM25 desc in FedWeb 2013 or the hybrid run in FedWeb 2012.Figure 3below shows the precision at 5 -1000 documents returned from running the modified queries on WT2g. We hope that the 10GB dataset next year will contain a higher percentage of Functional links.However  , the denormalized TPC-W fails to meet its SLA for two out of the 14 interaction types. Both implementations sustain roughly the same throughput.When considering whether the content of a lengthy video might be personally interesting to the participant  , small snippets of the original video can be invaluable. One participant searched for " Japanese anime " Observation J3 but was only interested in videos with associated English audio  , while Participant D was interested only in Chinese content with the original audio intact.Note that different workloads may benefit from additional features or optimizations than we choose for the TPC-W catalog object. Similar behavior can also be found in other applications such as IBM's geographically-distributed sporting and event service 9  , traditional web caching  , edge-server content assembly  , dynamic data caching 10 and personalization.In analyzing the runtime speedup for parallel LDA  , we trained LDA with 150 topics and 500 iterations. To conduct our scalability experiments  , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.TPC-W is an official benchmark to measure the performance of web servers and databases. SEARCHING FOR PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS IN THE TPC-W BENCHMARK We use the TPC-W Benchmark 24 for evaluation of our approach.Furthermore  , unlike on LETOR where the performance of ActiveAda-S-T converges more quickly than others  , we do not observe any trend of convergence up to the point with 2000 selected queries. It is more likely that these cross-domain relevant knowledge in source domain are even more helpful than those most informative target queries identified by Active-T.This comprises articles  , advertisements  , ocial notifications  , and the captions of illustrations see Table 1for details. The newspaper data set made available to us ranges from 1618 to 1995 4 and consists of more than 102 million OCRed newspaper items.Accordingly   , let IDCGp be the maximum possible discounted cumulative gain for a given query. We chose to standardize this issue  , using the same criterion used by most evaluation tools  , e.g.  , those available for the Letor 3.0 and 4.0 and Microsoft datasets  , in order to allow fairer comparisons.In the design of our prototype  , we considered but ultimately did not include these features that may be of use in other contexts. Note that different workloads may benefit from additional features or optimizations than we choose for the TPC-W catalog object.We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting  , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model. The Gaussian process allows the smoothing uncertainties in SoftRank to reflect modelling uncertainty in the learnt score function.In this paper we describe generation of datasets based on the Open Directory Project ODP  , http://dmoz.org  , although the techniques we propose are readily applicable to other Web directories  , as well as to non-Web hierarchies of documents see Section 2. The final processing step computes a number of performance metrics for the generated dataset.For example in Ask.com search site  , some uncached requests may take over one second but such a query will be answered quickly next time from a result cache. meet the soft deadline.Our empirical comparisons using the top-k recommendations metric show a surprisingly intuitive finding: that LDA performs consistently better than ARM for the community recommendation task when recommending a list of 4 or more communities.  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492  , 104 users and 118  , 002 communities.Design trade-offs for our distributed TPC-W system are guided by our project goal of providing high availability and good performance for e-commerce edge services as well as by technology trends. We also assume edge servers and the backend server communicate through secured channels though our current prototype does not encrypt network traffic.their ground truth difference with the production ranker would be the same as ordering them by the estimated difference. P -perfect user model setting  , I -informational  , N -navigational LETOR eval- uation.As it is known that the frequency of folksonomy data usually follows a power-law distribution 18  , this approach would allow statistical attacks if applied to a folksonomy. However  , the approach leaves associations between deterministically encrypted attributes intact.Most QA systems are substantial team efforts  , involving the design and maintenance of question taxonomies 14  , 15  , question classifiers  , and passage-scoring heuristics. Fal- con 14  , Webclopedia 15  , Mulder 18  , AnswerBus 28 and AskMSR 11 are some well-known research systems  , as are those built at the University of Waterloo 7  , 8  , and Ask Jeeves http://ask.com.The goal of LinkedGeoData is to add a spatial dimension to the Semantic Web. We have extended the ontology of LinkedGeoData by the appropriate classes and properties.As with our first batch of results presented for Ro- bust04  , we again assume the user provides correct feedback. Since we are only training on a single topic  , resulting accuracy is far lower than what typically published LETOR results.With LETOR  , in contrast  , features capture general properties of query-document compatibility . For example  , while the word " dog " might be very important to the current query  , RF on this query cannot tell us anything about how important this word should be for other queries.Otherwise  , we leave the trees intact. Notice that we merge two trees T i   , T ‚Ä≤ i only if a third tree has been propagated from level i ‚àí 1.Section 7 presents the relative performance of GlobeDB and different edge service architectures for the TPC-W benchmark. Section 6 presents an overview of GlobeDB implementation and its internal performance.The trees that remained intact during the last traversal are reused and the new aggregate values are added on. The two rightmost child trees are created again but now with the new values from the b1 subtree.oai_dc: contains only the accession id in the title field to satisfy the mandatory requirement of OAI. Two OAI metadata formats are provided for each OAI item: refseqp: contains the refseq records in our refseqp XML format.The tiny relation is a one column  , one tuple relation used to measure overhead. The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations.We take advantage of a production A/B testing environment at Booking.com  , which performs randomized controlled trials for the purpose of inferring causality. We consider the difference between the baseline and the newly proposed method significant when the G-test pvalue is larger than90%.We describe the behavioral  , topical  , temporal  , and other features in more detail later in the paper. To enable a richer analysis and of different feature sets we employed classifiers to assign topical labels to the clicks using the hierarchy from the Open Directory Project ODP  , dmoz.org 5 and the complexity of the queries/results  , based on estimates of their U.S. school grade level on a 1-12 scale 12.In addition  , 100% of the records were almost instantaneously mirrored on a subscribing news server  " beaufort " . 100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server  , " beatitude. "Rather than attempt to get an unbiased sample  , we randomly sampled 500 URIs from the Open Directory Project dmoz.org. As shown in 16  , 32  , 37  , finding a small sample set of URIs that represent the Internet is not trivial.Creative Commons is the most promising approach to the intellectual property problems  , which are otherwise a roadblock to progress in the use of educational technology. Others may be allowed to use the content only if left intact  , only for non-profit purposes  , or they might be allowed to manipulate it  , provided the original source is acknowledged  , for example.For example  , NASDAQ real-time data feeds include 3 ,000 to 6 ,000 messages per second in the pre-market hours 43; Network and application monitoring systems such as Net- Logger can also receive up to a thousand messages per sec- ond 44. Depending on the application  , the number of messages per second ranges from several to thousands.Snippets contain document title  , description  , and thumbnail image when available. The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.We also conducted experiments to observe the training curve of PermuRank.MAP in terms of MAP on OHSUMED. Figure 5and Figure 6show the results on the Letor TD2003 and TD2004 datasets.Cultural context may be a big reason why account gifting is more predominant in developing regions. She taught them how to upload pictures and leave scraps for each other  , and in this way  , was their gateway to Orkut.In the current system  , the page number of a scanned page is recognized by analyzing the OCRed text. As another example  , in case the program can not recognize the volume and issue number due to OCR error  , such as " IV " was OCRed as " it "   , the program will use the previous or the following title page information  , if available  , to construct the current volume or issue metadata.On all evaluation metrics the ranking perceptron achieves scores comparable to SVM on the OHSUMED and TD2003 datasets  , and comparable to RankBoost on TD2004. However  , to get an estimate for the accuracy of the methods we implemented  , we evaluated the ranking perceptron see Section 3  , on the Letor dataset 21.Last community is the withheld community while the rest are joined communities. The category of each community is defined on Orkut.In our experiments   , we focus on the ordering mix  , which generates the highest percentage of writes 50% of browsing and 50% of shopping interactions in this mix. TPC-W defines three workload mixes  , each with a different concentration of writes.We do suggest caution being taken when reviewing the Small Web Task to take the results in the context of the WT2g dataset  , lest one conclude that Connectivity Analysis does not improve precision in any case. It is our understanding that any implementation of these approaches would not succeed in improving precision to any usable extent  , if at all when the experiments were based on the WT2g dataset  , due to the lack of Functional links.It was expected that teachers with lower experience would be less likely to customize. Hypothesis 2 was posed to provide understanding of whether teachers' varying level of teaching experience influenced the desire to customize materials versus download them intact.Our snapshots were complete mirrors of the 154 Web Sites. The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.Orkut is a large social networking website.  Orkut.We have built a prototype of a hosting platform that implements the above ideas  , including the changes to the Linux kernel of the hosting servers to provide the above OS functions . To this end  , we introduce two new OS functions  , allowing the enacting agent  , which we refer to as local controller   , to explicitly swap in or out a suspended AppServ  , while leaving intact normal paging for active tasks.However  , the mean is a poor statistic to describe the power-law distributions of links on the web; average linkage is dominated by the many pages with few links and gives little insight into the topology. They concluded that linkage in WT2g was inadequate for web experiments.Orkut also offers friend relationship. Once a user joins orkut  , one can publish one's own profile  , upload photos  , and join communities of interest.Table 6shows the results obtained for some of these methods with the FedWeb 2012 collection. For the resource selection task we tested different variations of the strategies presented above.The second source of information is trade-level data for over 8000 publically traded companies on the NYSE  , AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges. 6 6 We do not consider the many important news stories that appear " after the bell  , " focusing here only on stories for which we have trading data.How to optimize towards diversity under the context LETOR is yet another problem to be studied in future. This is because we were counting on topic modelling based query expansion to improve diversity performance  , such that we have not defined a dedicated list-wise optimization criterion on top of the rank list that addresses diversity.It is our understanding that any implementation of these approaches would not succeed in improving precision to any usable extent  , if at all when the experiments were based on the WT2g dataset  , due to the lack of Functional links. We didn't implement any of these approaches  , as we felt that more was to be gained from developing our own ideas  , with the knowledge that the other methods existed.Explicit uncertainty information can  , of course  , be used for other purposes ‚Äî for example  , to provide for the user a confidence level for each document in the ranking. However  , we have found little evidence  , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set  , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG.Even though our approach is external and treats the system as a black box  , we gain many of the benefits of admission control and request scheduling. Driving the system with the industry-standard TPC-W benchmark  , Gatekeeper achieves both stable behavior during overload and dramatically improved response times.These interactions are emulated during benchmarking browsers by instrumented JavaScript which is independent of Web browsers. In WPBench  , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines. Besides  , since each snippet has both a title and a description  , we tested considering only the title field to match the query  , only the description field desc  , or both.Four thousand queries were adopted to gather samples from the diverse search engines; these samples were the basis for building descriptions for the informative resources at the various levels search engines and verticals. These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.It should be noted that for different classes of requests  , an application may deploy different termination ranges and control parameters and our API design can support such differentiation. Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.Figure 2: Family order traversal a breadth-first manner is as appropriate as traversing it in document order e.g. In this way we still manage to keep the sibling information intact without having to store whole levels of the tree during the traversal.Two OAI metadata formats are provided for each OAI item: refseqp: contains the refseq records in our refseqp XML format. A simple RefseqP XML schema was created for the RefSeqP OAI repository.It is a good datasest for our experiments since we will be discovering patterns from features that have already been proven to work. The LETOR dataset conveniently extracts many stateof-the-art features from documents  , including BM25 22  , HITS 14  , and Language Model 34.From the Wikia service  , we selected the encyclopedias Wookieepedia  , about the Star Wars universe  , and Muppet  , about the TV series " The Muppet Show " . From now on  , we refer to this encyclopedia as WPEDIA.For article features  , we normalized URL and Editor categories together  , and kept the CTR term a real value intact . For user features  , we normalized behavioral categories and the remaining features age  , gender and location separately   , due to the variable length of behavioral categories per user.Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability. As an instance of the method  , we optimize NDCG in this paper  , but other metrics in ranking can also be applied directly.WestartwitharunningexampleinFigure2.TheHTML formshownisasimplifiedsearchrequestpageforanonline bookstore as given in the TPC-W benchmark 20.

We first study the performance of OTW and DTW to investigate the costs and benefits of data denormalization with no scalability techniques being introduced.
